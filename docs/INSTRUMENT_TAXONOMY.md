# Instrument Taxonomy

## Category A: Gap-Bridging Instruments
*Documents addressing the space between nominal status and operational reality*

1. **Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody and Free Association Lease** [RATIFIED] — Transfers operational custody while preserving foundational ownership. See: [instruments/instrument_delegated_rights_custody.pdf](../instruments/instrument_delegated_rights_custody.pdf) and [analysis](../instruments/instrument_delegated_rights_custody.md)
2. **Certificate of Functional Citizenship** — Acknowledges legal citizenship while documenting diminished operational capacity
3. **Declaration of Conditional Sovereignty** — Formally acknowledges sovereignty while documenting specific non-operational instances
4. **Instrument of Deferred Equality** — Acknowledges nominal equal protection while inventorying discriminatory application
5. **Notice of Rights Under Suspension** — Formal filing documenting functionally suspended but technically valid rights

## Category B: Distributed Accountability Instruments
*Documents creating mesh networks of responsibility and authority*

6. **Compact of Mutual Witness** [RATIFIED] — Charter for distributed accountability and pattern documentation. Creates reciprocal obligations for evidence preservation, testimonial support, and pattern correlation. Features independent invocation authority, reputational accountability, and distributed exclusion mechanisms enabling infinite scalability. See: [instruments/compact_of_mutual_witness.md](../instruments/compact_of_mutual_witness.md)
7. **Compact of Mutual Intervention** [RATIFIED] — Charter for outside accountability when sovereignty degrades. Extends NATO Article 5 logic to institutional failures: systematic sovereignty degradation affecting any citizens is considered a threat to all citizens' sovereignty. Establishes mutual assistance obligations for monitoring, documentation, advocacy, and pressure when domestic accountability mechanisms fail comprehensively. Features distributed invocation authority, exhaustion of remedies requirement, and recognition of actions independent of formal execution. See: [instruments/compact_mutual_intervention.md](../instruments/compact_mutual_intervention.md)
8. **Instrument of Accountability Escrow** — Places documented misconduct "in escrow" for release upon triggering conditions
9. **Charter of Rotating Custody** — Designates rotating roster of advocates to ensure continuity
10. **Protocol of Cascading Designation** — Pre-authorizes sequential assumption of custodial authority if prior designees unable to act

## Category C: Conscience-Based Authority Instruments
*Documents deriving force from documentation and moral logic*

11. **Deed of Moral Encumbrance** — Attaches documented ethical claim to property or institutions as "moral lien"
12. **Instrument of Conditional Legitimacy** — Formal statement that compliance with laws/institutions is conditional upon performance criteria
13. **Declaration of Anticipatory Vindication** — Documents position outside mainstream with expectation of future recognition
14. **Certificate of Institutional Non-Recognition** — Formally documents non-recognition of legitimacy of particular institution or action

## Category D: Activation-Upon-Failure Instruments
*Documents that lie dormant until triggered by institutional non-performance*

15. **Automatic Publicity Covenant** — Pre-authorizes documentation release upon institutional failure within timeframes
16. **Instrument of Remedial Escalation** — Establishes response ladder with automatic escalation at documented thresholds
17. **Conditional Withdrawal of Consent** — Articulates that consent to governance is conditional with documented withdrawal triggers
18. **Charter of Alternative Jurisdiction** — Pre-establishes alternative dispute resolution activating upon pattern failures

## Category E: Aggregation Instruments
*Documents enabling individual claims to consolidate into collective authority*

19. **Registry of Distributed Grievance** — Standardized format for documenting instances designed to aggregate into collective record
20. **Instrument of Fractional Standing** — Allows individuals to contribute standing fraction to pooled authority
21. **Compact of Synchronized Assertion** — Coordinates timing of multiple claims to create simultaneous pressure
22. **Protocol of Precedent Pooling** — Enables sharing of favorable rulings and precedential material

## Category F: Meta-Instruments
*Documents about the creation and governance of other instruments*

23. **Constitutional Audit Charter** — Establishes methodology for systematic gap review with reporting requirements
24. **Instrument of Instrument Creation** — Framework establishing principles, constraints, and legitimacy conditions
25. **Registry of Unofficial Law** — Documents actual operating rules versus stated rules
