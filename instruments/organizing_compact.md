# Organizing Compact for Distributed Accountability Networks

**A Substrate for Formalizing Collective Action Under the Remedial Legitimacy Framework**

**Category**: F. Meta-Instruments
**Status**: RATIFIED
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2026-01-21

## Preamble

The instruments of the Remedial Legitimacy Framework—the Compact of Mutual Witness, the Compact of Mutual Intervention, the Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody, and the Instrument of Conditional Legitimacy—establish theoretical foundations for distributed accountability. Yet theoretical instruments require organizational substrate to become operational.

This Organizing Compact provides that substrate: a framework for formalizing networks of signatories who commit to mutual accountability obligations. It adapts governance structures from cooperative and mutual enterprise—dynamic contribution assessment, distributed decision-making, graduated participation rights—to the specific needs of accountability networks operating across jurisdictions and institutional contexts.

The success of this structure depends entirely on the good faith and high-trust collaboration of its Signatories. Unlike commercial enterprises measured by profit, accountability networks are measured by documented institutional failures remediated, sovereignty preserved, and patterns interrupted. The governance structures herein serve those ends.

## Article I: Formation and Purpose

**1.1 Formation.** Signatories to this Compact hereby form a distributed accountability network (the "Network") operating under the principles of the Remedial Legitimacy Framework.

**1.2 Name.** The Network shall be known by whatever designation its Signatories adopt, or may operate without formal name where anonymity serves protective purposes.

**1.3 Distributed Presence.** The Network has no principal office. Signatories operate from their respective locations. Coordination occurs through documentation networks, secure communications, and shared protocols rather than centralized infrastructure.

**1.4 Purpose.** The purpose of the Network is to:
- Provide mutual accountability assistance under the Compact of Mutual Intervention
- Preserve and correlate documentation under the Compact of Mutual Witness
- Support delegated rights defense under the Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody
- Document conditional legitimacy positions under the Instrument of Conditional Legitimacy
- Develop, refine, and propagate accountability instruments and methodologies
- Any activities necessary or incidental to distributed accountability

---

## Article II: Definitions

**2.1 "Contribution Committee"** means the body elected by Active Signatories to assess Accountability Contribution and recognize participation levels.

**2.2 "Accountability Contribution"** means the value a Signatory brings to the Network, measured by:
- Documentation created, preserved, or verified
- Invocations supported or responded to
- Pattern analysis and correlation work
- Technical infrastructure maintained
- Training and capacity building provided
- Strategic coordination facilitated
- Resources contributed to network operations

**2.3 "Active Signatory"** means any Signatory who has made meaningful Accountability Contribution within the preceding twelve months.

**2.4 "Founding Signatory"** means an initial Signatory present at the Network's formation, holding transitional governance rights as specified in Section 3.2.

**2.5 "Supporting Signatory"** means a Signatory who contributes resources (financial, technical, or material) but does not engage in direct accountability work, with governance rights subject to the sunset mechanism in Section 3.6.

**2.6 "Coordinating Council"** means the elected body described in Article VI.

**2.7 "Working Circle"** means a self-organizing group within the Network focused on a specific jurisdiction, institutional pattern, or accountability function.

**2.8 "Threshold Documentation"** has the meaning established in the Compact of Mutual Intervention.

## Article III: Signatories and Participation Structure

**3.1 Initial Signatories.** The initial Signatories of the Network are listed in the founding record, or where the Network forms through gradual accretion, are those who first coordinated under these principles.

**3.2 Signatory Classes.**

**(a) Active Signatories:** Individuals or collectives who have made Accountability Contribution and participate in Network operations. Only Active Signatories have full governance rights.

**(b) Founding Signatories:** The initial organizers, holding transitional authority over the following foundational matters for a period of three (3) years from formation:
- Amendment of Articles I, II, or III of this Compact
- Dissolution of the Network
- Fundamental alteration of the Network's relationship to the Remedial Legitimacy Framework

Upon expiration of this sunset period, Founding Signatories convert to Active Signatories with no special rights. This transitional authority exists solely to protect the Network's foundational character during establishment, not to concentrate permanent power.

**(c) Supporting Signatories:** Those who contribute resources without direct accountability work, as specified in Section 3.6.

**3.3 Admission of New Signatories.** New Signatories may be admitted upon:
- Execution of this Compact
- Vouching by at least one existing Active Signatory, OR
- Demonstrated Accountability Contribution consistent with Network principles

No supermajority vote required. The Network grows through demonstrated alignment, not gatekeeping. However, the Coordinating Council may, upon documented evidence of bad faith or harm, exclude parties whose participation would compromise Network integrity.

**3.4 Accountability Contributions.** Each Signatory's contributions are recognized through the dynamic assessment process in Article IV. No specific contribution is required for initial participation; the Network values diverse capacities and circumstances.

**3.5 No Compelled Contributions.** No Signatory shall be obligated to contribute beyond their capacity or circumstances. Asymmetric contribution is expected and honored—those with greater capacity contribute more; those with lesser capacity contribute what they can. The Network's strength derives from collective aggregation, not individual burden.

**3.6 Supporting Signatories - Resource Contributors.**

**3.6.1 Purpose and Intent.** The Network may receive support from parties who contribute resources but do not engage in direct accountability work. This section permits such support while protecting the Network's core principle that governance derives from accountability labor, not capital.

**3.6.2 Creation of Supporting Signatory Status.** The Network may recognize Supporting Signatories by consensus of Active Signatories. Supporting Signatories have voice in Network deliberations but limited voting rights, as set forth in this Section.

**3.6.3 Governance Rights Sunset Mechanism.**

(a) *Initial Right:* Upon recognition, a Supporting Signatory may be granted advisory participation in governance matters.

(b) *Reduction Principle:* As the Network's accountability work expands—measured by documentation volume, invocations processed, patterns documented, and institutional responses generated—the relative governance weight of resource contribution diminishes compared to accountability labor.

(c) *Operational Effect:* Supporting Signatories may participate in deliberations and offer counsel, but binding decisions on Network direction, invocations, and responses rest with Active Signatories who bear the accountability work.

**3.6.4 Recognition Rights.** The reduction of governance participation in no way diminishes Supporting Signatories' recognition for their contributions. Resource support enables accountability work; that enabling function deserves acknowledgment even as governance remains with those doing the work.

**3.6.5 Information Rights.** Supporting Signatories shall have access to Network documentation and reporting appropriate to their contribution level, but not access to sensitive operational information where such access could compromise affected parties or Network security.

**3.6.6 Contribution Conditions.** Supporting Signatory contributions may not be conditioned on governance rights, specific Network actions, or outcomes. Resources given with strings attached compromise Network independence and should be declined.

---

## Article IV: Dynamic Recognition and Coordination

**4.1 Contribution Recognition.** The Network maintains ongoing recognition of Signatory contributions. Unlike commercial equity, this recognition does not confer ownership—the Network owns nothing and is owned by no one. Recognition serves coordination: identifying who has capacity, expertise, and standing in particular domains.

**4.2 Annual Assessment Process.**

(a) A Contribution Committee of three (3) Active Signatories shall be selected annually through a process determined by the Active Signatories (election, rotation, sortition, or consensus).

(b) The Committee shall assess each Signatory's Accountability Contribution over the prior period, recognizing:
- Documentation work (creation, preservation, verification, correlation)
- Invocation support (preparation, response, coordination)
- Infrastructure maintenance (technical, communications, security)
- Capacity building (training, mentorship, methodology development)
- Strategic contribution (analysis, planning, liaison)

(c) Assessment serves recognition and coordination, not reward or punishment. The Network does not distribute profits; it distributes acknowledgment and responsibility.

(d) Any Signatory may request explanation of their assessment. The Committee shall provide rationale within fifteen (15) days.

(e) *Dispute Process:* A Signatory disputing their assessment may, within thirty (30) days, request review by an ad-hoc panel of three (3) randomly selected Active Signatories. The panel's recommendation to the Committee shall be given substantial weight.

**4.3 Resource Allocation.** Where the Network holds pooled resources (documentation infrastructure, communication systems, emergency funds), the Coordinating Council shall allocate resources to support accountability work. Allocation priorities:
- Active invocations and responses
- Documentation preservation at risk
- Capacity building in underserved areas
- Infrastructure maintaining Network operations
- Emergency support for Signatories facing retaliation

**4.4 Signatory Transitions.**

(a) *Voluntary Withdrawal:* Any Signatory may withdraw at any time by providing notice. Withdrawing Signatories should, where possible, transfer custodial responsibilities for documentation and complete ongoing commitments.

(b) *Exclusion for Cause:* A Signatory may be excluded upon documented evidence of:
- Bad faith invocations or false documentation
- Actions creating new harms in violation of ethical constraints
- Compromise of Network security or affected party safety
- Persistent failure to honor mutual assistance commitments despite capacity

Exclusion requires supermajority (66%) of Active Signatories and must be documented with specific findings.

(c) *Inactive Status:* Signatories who have not contributed for twelve (12) months transition to inactive status. They retain recognition for past contributions and may return to active status upon resumed contribution. Inactive Signatories do not vote on Network matters.

## Article V: Governance and Decision-Making

**5.1 Governance by Coordinating Council.** The Network shall be coordinated by a Council elected by Active Signatories. The Council's powers are derivative—it implements decisions made by Signatories and manages operational coordination, not policy direction.

**5.2 Election and Composition of the Coordinating Council.**

(a) The initial Council shall consist of Founding Signatories or their designees.

(b) After one year, Active Signatories shall select Council members through a process they determine (election, rotation, sortition, or consensus). Council terms should be staggered to maintain continuity.

(c) The Council shall designate a facilitator to coordinate meetings and serve as liaison where external representation is necessary.

(d) No Signatory shall serve on both the Coordinating Council and the Contribution Committee simultaneously.

**5.3 Powers of the Coordinating Council.** The Council is authorized to:
- Coordinate responses to invocations
- Manage shared infrastructure and resources
- Facilitate communication among Signatories and Working Circles
- Represent the Network in external liaisons where representation is necessary
- Propose policies and priorities for Signatory decision

The Council shall NOT unilaterally:
- Alter Signatory rights or obligations under this Compact
- Approve or terminate Working Circles except implementing Signatory decisions
- Commit the Network to positions or actions without Signatory authorization
- Allocate resources in ways that compromise Network independence

**5.4 Voting by Signatories.**

Active Signatories shall have one (1) vote per Signatory (individual or collective). Supporting Signatories have voice but not vote. Founding Signatories vote as Active Signatories, subject to their transitional authority.

(a) The following require Supermajority (75%) of Active Signatories:
- Amendment of this Compact
- Dissolution of the Network
- Fundamental alteration of relationship to Remedial Legitimacy Framework
- Exclusion of a Signatory

(b) The following require Supermajority (66%) of Active Signatories:
- Admission standards changes
- Removal of Council members
- Major resource allocation decisions
- Formation of binding external partnerships

(c) Ordinary matters proceed by simple majority or consensus as the Signatories determine.

**5.5 Distributed Decision-Making.** The Network operates on subsidiarity: decisions should be made at the most local level capable of addressing them effectively.

- Working Circles decide matters within their domain
- The Council coordinates across Circles and manages shared resources
- Full Signatory votes reserved for matters affecting the whole Network
- Individual Signatories retain authority for their own invocations and responses

No permission required to act consistently with Framework principles. Coordination enhances effectiveness but is not prerequisite for action.

---

## Article VI: Working Circles

**6.1 Purpose of Working Circles.** Working Circles are self-organizing groups focused on specific accountability functions: jurisdictional coverage, institutional patterns, technical infrastructure, methodology development, or other coherent domains.

**6.2 Formation of Working Circles.**

(a) Any Active Signatory may propose a Working Circle by describing:
- The accountability function or domain
- Initial participants
- Relationship to existing Circles and Network priorities
- Resources needed from the Network (if any)

(b) Working Circles form upon proposal; no approval required. The Council tracks active Circles for coordination purposes.

(c) Circles that duplicate existing functions or create conflicts should coordinate with existing Circles. The Council may facilitate such coordination but cannot prohibit Circle formation.

**6.3 Autonomy and Accountability.** Working Circles are self-managing but accountable to Network principles.

(a) Circles operate autonomously within their domain, setting their own processes and priorities.

(b) Circles must operate consistently with Framework ethical constraints (no new harms, truthfulness, proportionality).

(c) Circles report periodically to the Network on their activities, enabling coordination and pattern correlation across Circles.

(d) Circles that persistently violate ethical constraints or compromise Network integrity may be disaffiliated by supermajority (66%) of Active Signatories.

**6.4 Working Circle Resources.** Where the Network allocates resources to Circles:

(a) Resource allocation follows demonstrated accountability contribution and current priorities.

(b) Circles retain operational control of allocated resources within their accountability function.

(c) The Council coordinates resource sharing across Circles and manages conflicts.

## Article VII: Relationship to Framework Instruments

**7.1 Compact of Mutual Witness Integration.** This Network operates as an organizing structure for Mutual Witness obligations:
- Signatories may serve as Custodians for documentation
- Working Circles may focus on specific preservation domains
- Network infrastructure supports distributed preservation
- Cross-Signatory correlation enables pattern documentation

**7.2 Compact of Mutual Intervention Integration.** This Network provides mutual assistance infrastructure:
- Invocations may be coordinated through the Network
- Working Circles may focus on specific affected jurisdictions
- Resource pooling enables responses beyond individual capacity
- Distributed structure provides resilience against suppression

**7.3 Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody Integration.** Network Signatories may serve as Lessees or Secondary Designees:
- The Network provides pool of potential Custodians
- Working Circles may specialize in particular rights domains
- Network resources support custody functions
- Coordination enhances delegated defense capacity

**7.4 Instrument of Conditional Legitimacy Integration.** Network documentation supports conditional legitimacy positions:
- Pattern evidence substantiates institutional failure claims
- Distributed verification strengthens legitimacy of positions
- Network resources support affected parties documenting conditionality
- Correlation across jurisdictions demonstrates systematic rather than isolated failures

**7.5 Independence of Instruments.** Each Framework instrument operates independently. This Organizing Compact provides optional coordination infrastructure—Signatories to individual instruments need not participate in the Network, and Network participation does not require execution of all instruments.

---

## Article VIII: Documentation and Transparency

**8.1 Network Records.** The Network shall maintain:
- Registry of Signatories (with appropriate privacy protections)
- Record of Working Circles and their domains
- Documentation of Council decisions and Signatory votes
- Assessment records (contribution recognition)
- Resource allocation records

**8.2 Transparency Principles.** Network operations should be as transparent as consistent with:
- Safety of affected parties
- Security of Signatories in hostile jurisdictions
- Operational effectiveness requiring confidentiality
- Privacy rights of individuals documented

Default to transparency; confidentiality requires justification.

**8.3 External Reporting.** The Network may publish periodic reports on:
- Accountability activities (aggregated, anonymized where necessary)
- Patterns documented and institutional responses observed
- Methodology developments and lessons learned
- Network growth and capacity

Such reporting serves accountability transparency and enables others to learn from Network experience.

---

## Article IX: Dispute Resolution

**9.1 Internal Resolution First.** Disputes among Signatories should be resolved through:
- Direct communication between parties
- Facilitation by Council or neutral Signatories
- Working Circle processes where disputes concern Circle matters

**9.2 Escalation.** Disputes unresolved through internal processes may be escalated to:
- Ad-hoc panel of randomly selected Active Signatories
- External mediation by mutually agreed mediator
- Arbitration where parties agree

**9.3 Principles for Resolution.** Dispute resolution should be guided by:
- Good faith engagement
- Focus on accountability mission over personal conflict
- Proportionality of process to stakes involved
- Documentation for institutional learning
- Preservation of relationships where possible

**9.4 Limits of Resolution.** Some disputes may be unresolvable. Signatories who cannot work together may operate in separate Working Circles or, ultimately, separate Networks. Schism is preferable to paralysis or persistent conflict that compromises accountability work.

---

## Article X: Dissolution and Succession

**10.1 Events Causing Dissolution.** The Network dissolves upon:
- Supermajority (75%) vote of Active Signatories
- Reduction of Active Signatories below minimum viable operations
- Achievement of purpose (comprehensive remedy of institutional failures addressed)

**10.2 Succession of Obligations.** Upon dissolution:
- Documentation custody transfers to successor networks, archives, or affected parties
- Ongoing invocation responses should be completed or transferred
- Resources distributed to continuing accountability work or returned to contributors
- Network records preserved for historical accountability

**10.3 Continuity of Instruments.** Dissolution of the Network does not affect the underlying Framework instruments. Signatories retain their individual commitments under those instruments and may form new networks or operate independently.

---

## Article XI: General Provisions

**11.1 Governing Principles.** This Compact shall be interpreted according to:
- The theoretical foundations of the Remedial Legitimacy Framework
- The ethical constraints articulated in the constituent instruments
- Plain meaning of terms
- Good faith engagement among Signatories

**11.2 Relationship to Law.** This Compact operates within applicable law. Nothing herein authorizes illegal action. Where legal frameworks conflict with accountability obligations, Signatories navigate those conflicts according to their conscience and circumstances, bearing responsibility for their choices.

**11.3 Amendment.** This Compact may be amended by Supermajority (75%) of Active Signatories. Amendments should be documented with rationale and effective date.

**11.4 Cultural Commitment.** The Signatories acknowledge that this Compact is founded on high trust, mutual accountability, and direct communication. While this clause creates no legally enforceable obligation, all Signatories commit to engaging with transparency, fairness, and constructive intent to uphold the spirit of distributed accountability.

---

## Execution

This Compact becomes effective upon execution by any Signatory. Each Signatory executes in their individual or collective capacity, understanding that:

- Obligations are aspirational and proportionate to capacity
- No Signatory can bind others to specific actions
- Good faith effort honors the spirit of mutual accountability
- The Network's strength derives from voluntary coordination, not compulsion

Consistent with Article VIII.4 of the Compact of Mutual Intervention, actions consistent with this Compact's logic operate validly whether or not formal execution occurred. Parties already coordinating accountability work under these principles are recognized as operating under Compact logic.

## Commentary

### Adaptation from Commercial to Accountability Context

This Compact adapts governance structures designed for commercial enterprises to the distinct needs of accountability networks:

**Dynamic Equity → Dynamic Recognition:** Commercial dynamic equity allocates ownership and profit shares. Accountability networks have nothing to own or distribute—their "product" is documented institutional failures, preserved evidence, and supported affected parties. Dynamic recognition serves coordination: identifying who has contributed what, who has expertise where, who has capacity for what.

**Capital Classes → Participation Classes:** Commercial structures distinguish capital contributors from labor contributors. Accountability networks distinguish accountability labor (documentation, invocation, response) from supporting contributions (resources, infrastructure). Governance derives from accountability labor because that's what the network exists to do.

**Profit Distribution → Resource Allocation:** Commercial enterprises distribute profits to owners. Accountability networks allocate resources to accountability work—prioritizing active invocations, at-risk documentation, capacity building, and infrastructure.

**Micro-Communities → Working Circles:** Commercial platforms spin off entrepreneurial units pursuing market opportunities. Accountability networks form Working Circles around jurisdictions, institutions, patterns, or functions. Autonomy enables responsiveness; accountability to principles prevents drift.

### Relationship to Distributed Architecture

The Remedial Legitimacy Framework emphasizes distributed architecture: no central authority, independent invocation, resilience through redundancy. This Organizing Compact provides *optional* coordination infrastructure that enhances effectiveness without compromising distributed principles:

- Coordination is valuable but not required
- Working Circles operate autonomously
- Individual Signatories retain invocation authority
- The Network can be suppressed without destroying the underlying instruments
- Multiple Networks can operate in parallel without conflict

### The Trust Foundation

Commercial operating agreements ultimately rely on legal enforcement. Accountability networks operate in contexts where legal enforcement may be unavailable, compromised, or hostile. The Cultural Commitment in Section 11.4 acknowledges that this Compact's effectiveness depends on:

- Signatories who genuinely share accountability commitments
- Good faith engagement even in disagreement
- Willingness to bear costs of mutual assistance
- Recognition that the network serves affected parties, not itself

Networks built on these foundations can accomplish what legal enforcement cannot. Networks lacking these foundations will fail regardless of their formal structures.
