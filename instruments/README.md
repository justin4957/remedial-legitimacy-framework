## Collection

### 1. Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody and Free Association Lease

**Category**: A. Gap-Bridging Instruments
**Status**: RATIFIED
**Format**: PDF + Analysis

**Files**:
- [instrument_delegated_rights_custody.pdf](./instrument_delegated_rights_custody.pdf) - The complete instrument document
- [instrument_delegated_rights_custody.md](./instrument_delegated_rights_custody.md) - Detailed analysis and commentary

**Summary**: Transfers operational custody of constitutional rights to willing third parties during periods of institutional non-performance, while preserving foundational ownership. Establishes mechanism for rights defense through delegated Custodial Authority that activates upon documented Degradation Events.

**Key Innovations**:
- Inversion of standing doctrine (violation activates authority rather than possession)
- Operational vs. foundational ownership distinction
- Self-executing activation independent of institutional recognition
- Degradation-as-multiplier mechanism
- Secondary Designee delegation capability
- Aggregation principle across multiple rights-holders

### 2. Compact of Mutual Witness

**Category**: B. Distributed Accountability Instruments
**Status**: RATIFIED
**Format**: Markdown (comprehensive charter document)
**Version**: 0.4

**Files**:
- [compact_of_mutual_witness.md](./compact_of_mutual_witness.md) - Complete charter with articles, commentary, and legal analysis

**Summary**: Charter for distributed accountability and pattern documentation. Creates reciprocal aspirational obligations for evidence preservation, testimonial support, and pattern correlation. Enables distributed networks to scale indefinitely while maintaining quality control through innovative governance mechanisms.

**Key Innovations**:
- Independent invocation authority (any Signatory may act on constitutional authority without consensus or permission)
- Reputational accountability (known documentation possession creates moral custody; inaction becomes tacit complicity)
- Distributed exclusion (bad actors excluded through reputational cascades rather than formal voting)
- Retroactive documentation custodianship (enables multi-generational pattern documentation)
- Network ascension through time (historical documentation "rises" into preservation network)
- Aspirational charter tone (recognizes practical constraints while articulating principles to strive toward)
- Resolves open participation + quality control + scalability trilemma
- Legal compliance integration (Article IV.5, X.4: operates within law, acknowledges compelled disclosure)
- Forensic preservation standards (Article II.2: NIST guidelines, chain of custody, SHA-256 hashing)
