## Preamble

### The Highest Aspiration: Rights Protection as Institutional Obligation

The preservation and defense of fundamental rights represents the highest aspiration of constitutional governance. Institutions—courts, legislatures, executive agencies, law enforcement—exist not merely to wield authority but to safeguard the liberties they are constituted to protect. When these institutions instead become the source of rights violations, they breach the foundational compact that legitimates their power.

### The Gap Between Authority and Legitimacy

Compliance with law is conventionally understood as unconditional obligation: citizens must obey regardless of whether institutions uphold their own foundational principles. This asymmetry creates a power imbalance where institutional performance failures trigger no corresponding release from citizen obligations.

When courts delay justice for years while demanding immediate compliance with their orders, when police violate constitutional rights while enforcing laws against rights violations, when agencies ignore their statutory mandates while prosecuting minor regulatory infractions—the gap between authority-as-claimed and legitimacy-as-earned becomes operational reality.

Yet individuals who recognize this gap and condition their cooperation on institutional good faith lack any framework to articulate this position. Civil disobedience expresses it through action but creates legal jeopardy. Conscientious objection addresses narrow categories. No general instrument exists for documenting that one's compliance is not unconditional consent but conditional cooperation contingent on institutional performance.

### The Sovereignty Breach and Defensive Posture

Under international law, states possess an inherent right to self-defense when subjected to armed attack (UN Charter, Chapter VII, Article 51). This right acknowledges that aggression against a sovereign entity creates a defensive posture—a moral and legal justification for protective response proportional to the threat.

An analogous logic applies when institutions responsible for protecting constitutional rights instead become agents of their degradation. When the guardian becomes the aggressor, when the protector becomes the violator, a sovereignty breach occurs: the popular sovereignty vested in institutions to secure liberties is turned against those very liberties.

This breach creates a defensive posture for rights-holders. Not a license for violence or lawlessness, but a moral and philosophical foundation for conditioning cooperation on institutional performance. Just as international law recognizes that states need not acquiesce to aggression, this Instrument recognizes that individuals need not mistake institutional rights-violations for legitimate authority.

### Proportionality and Distinction

Drawing from principles of proportionality and distinction in international humanitarian law, this Instrument aspires to ensure that:

**Proportionality**: Any assertion of conditional legitimacy must be proportional to the severity, pattern, and persistence of documented institutional failures. Isolated or minor deficiencies do not justify broad conditionality; systematic and severe violations may warrant more substantial declarations.

**Distinction**: Conditionality must distinguish between institutions and individuals, between systemic failures and isolated acts, between those responsible for violations and those who faithfully execute their duties. Blanket rejection of all authority based on specific institutional failures violates the principle of distinction.

These principles transform righteous indignation into structured accountability, preventing disproportionate response while preserving the moral force of the defensive posture.

### The Documentary Function

This Instrument of Conditional Legitimacy aspires to provide such a framework. It is fundamentally a **documentary instrument**: a formal record of conscience, ethical position, and conditional cooperation. It does not grant legal immunity, authorize lawbreaking, or create enforceable rights. It articulates moral and philosophical positions about the relationship between authority and legitimacy.

The instrument's power derives not from legal recognition but from documentation itself: creating a contemporaneous record that one's compliance is conditional, that one recognizes institutional failures, and that one's cooperation should not be mistaken for endorsement of institutional non-performance.

This positions the declarant for potential future vindication if institutional failures become more widely recognized, provides basis for conscience-based arguments in any subsequent proceedings, and establishes that silence should not be construed as consent.

### What This Instrument Is NOT

This Instrument is **not**:
- A declaratory judgment or petition for judicial relief under federal or state declaratory judgment acts;
- An attempt to circumvent, replace, or substitute for judicial review processes;
- A legal instrument creating enforceable rights, obligations, or defenses;
- An authorization to violate law or evade legitimate institutional authority;
- A claim of immunity from legal consequences or court jurisdiction.

This is a documentary and philosophical instrument—a contemporaneous record of conscience, not a legal shield.

## Article I: Definitions

**1.1 Declarant**

The individual or organization executing this Instrument, asserting conditional compliance with specified institutional authorities.

**1.2 Subject Institution(s)**

The specific governmental entity, regulatory agency, court, law enforcement body, or other authority-claiming institution whose legitimacy the Declarant conditions upon performance criteria.

**1.3 Degradation Event**

A documented instance where a Subject Institution fails to uphold its own foundational principles, statutory obligations, constitutional constraints, or stated policies, thereby diminishing its claim to legitimate authority.

**1.4 Performance Criterion**

A specific, measurable standard against which Subject Institution conduct is evaluated, derived from the institution's own stated obligations (constitutional provisions, statutory mandates, regulatory requirements, procedural rules, or explicitly stated policies).

**1.5 Conditional Legitimacy**

The philosophical position that an institution's claim to authority is contingent upon its performance in meeting its own stated obligations, and that compliance with institutional directives is a matter of contingent cooperation rather than unconditional obligation.

**1.6 Documentary Record**

The formal documentation of Degradation Events, Performance Criteria, and the Declarant's position regarding conditionality, created contemporaneously with institutional failures and preserved for potential future relevance.

**1.7 Good-Faith Exhaustion**

Genuine attempts to seek remedy through official channels, demonstrating that the Declarant has not bypassed available institutional remedies but has engaged with institutional processes before declaring conditionality.

**1.8 Proportionality**

The principle, derived from international humanitarian law, that the degree of conditionality asserted must correspond to the severity, pattern, and persistence of documented institutional failures. Isolated or minor deficiencies do not justify broad conditionality; systematic and severe violations may warrant more substantial declarations. Proportionality ensures defensive response does not exceed the scope of institutional aggression.

**1.9 Distinction**

The principle, derived from international humanitarian law, that conditionality must distinguish between institutions and individuals, between systemic failures and isolated acts, between those responsible for violations and those who faithfully execute their duties. Blanket rejection of all legal authority based on specific institutional failures violates the principle of distinction.

**1.10 Sovereignty Breach**

The condition that occurs when institutions constitutionally obligated to protect and secure fundamental rights instead become agents of their degradation. When the guardian becomes the aggressor, the popular sovereignty vested in institutions to safeguard liberties is turned against those very liberties, creating a defensive posture for rights-holders analogous to the right of self-defense recognized in international law (UN Charter, Chapter VII, Article 51).

**1.11 Defensive Posture**

The moral and philosophical foundation, created by Sovereignty Breach, that justifies conditioning cooperation on institutional performance. Not a license for violence or lawlessness, but recognition that individuals need not mistake institutional rights-violations for legitimate authority. Analogous to the inherent right of self-defense when subjected to aggression, applied in the context of institutional failures rather than armed attack.

## Article II: Declaration of Conditional Legitimacy

### 2.1 The Conditional Relationship

This Instrument aspires to articulate that the Declarant's compliance with laws, regulations, and directives of Subject Institution(s) is conditional upon those institutions meeting Performance Criteria derived from their own foundational obligations.

The Declarant asserts that:
- Authority derives from meeting obligations, not merely claiming power;
- Legitimacy must be earned through performance, not presumed from institutional status;
- Compliance represents conditional cooperation, not unconditional endorsement;
- Institutional non-performance degrades claim to legitimate authority;
- The burden of demonstrating compliance with foundational principles properly rests with the institution claiming authority.

### 2.2 Specification of Conditionality

The Declarant specifies:
- **Subject Institution(s)**: [Specific institutions, not blanket rejection of all governmental authority]
- **Performance Criteria**: [Specific constitutional provisions, statutory obligations, procedural requirements, or institutional policies that form the basis for conditionality]
- **Documented Failures**: [Specific Degradation Events with evidence]
- **Scope of Conditionality**: [Which laws, regulations, or directives are subject to conditional compliance, limited to those connected to documented failures]

### 2.3 Documentary vs. Operational Effect

This Instrument creates a **documentary record** of the Declarant's philosophical and ethical position. It aspires to:
- Establish contemporaneous documentation of conscience-based conditionality;
- Create record for potential future relevance if institutional failures become more widely acknowledged;
- Demonstrate that cooperation should not be construed as endorsement;
- Provide basis for arguments about diminished institutional legitimacy;
- Position Declarant for potential vindication through historical perspective.

This Instrument does **not**:
- Authorize violation of law;
- Create legal immunity from consequences of non-compliance;
- Constitute legal defense or justification for unlawful conduct;
- Establish enforceable rights or obligations;
- Replace or circumvent available legal processes.

---

## Article III: Conditions for Declaration

### 3.1 Documentation of Institutional Failure

The Declarant aspires to document Degradation Events through:
- **Specificity**: Particular instances, not generalized grievances;
- **Evidence**: Contemporary documentation (court records, government documents, media reports, testimony, audio/visual records);
- **Pattern Recognition**: Demonstration that failures are systematic rather than isolated;
- **Connection to Authority**: Clear relationship between institutional failures and the laws/directives subject to conditionality.

### 3.2 Good-Faith Institutional Engagement

Before declaring conditional legitimacy, the Declarant aspires to demonstrate:
- Use of available official complaint or grievance procedures;
- Attempts to seek remedy through institutional channels;
- Engagement with oversight bodies where available;
- Documentation of institutional non-response or inadequate response;
- Meaningful opportunity for institutions to remedy failures before declaration.

### 3.3 Proportionality Requirement

The degree of conditionality asserted aspires to be proportional to:
- Severity of documented institutional failures;
- Pattern persistence and breadth;
- Connection between failures and subject laws/directives;
- Availability of alternative remedies.

Isolated, minor, or remediable failures do not justify broad conditional legitimacy declarations.

### 3.4 Limitation to Connected Authority

Conditionality aspires to be limited to:
- Laws, regulations, or directives directly connected to documented institutional failures;
- Subject Institutions whose failures are documented (not all governmental authority);
- Specific time periods during which failures are active and unaddressed.

Blanket rejection of all legal authority based on select institutional failures is not proportional and exceeds the scope of this Instrument.

---

## Article IV: Documentation Requirements

### 4.1 Core Documentation

The Declarant aspires to maintain contemporaneous documentation including:
- **Institutional Failures**: Specific Degradation Events with dates, locations, involved parties, and evidence;
- **Performance Criteria**: Explicit citation to constitutional provisions, statutes, regulations, or institutional policies violated;
- **Good-Faith Efforts**: Record of attempts to seek remedy through official channels;
- **Institutional Responses**: Documentation of how institutions responded (or failed to respond) to raised concerns;
- **Scope Specification**: Clear articulation of which authorities are subject to conditionality and why.

### 4.2 Evidence Standards

Documentation aspires to meet standards that would be:
- Admissible in legal proceedings (properly authenticated, not hearsay where possible);
- Contemporaneous (created at or near time of Degradation Events);
- Verifiable (capable of independent confirmation);
- Specific (identifying particular incidents, not general claims);
- Proportional (sufficient to support the degree of conditionality asserted).

### 4.3 Preservation and Chain of Custody

The Declarant aspires to preserve documentation through:
- Multiple secure copies (digital and physical where appropriate);
- SHA-256 or equivalent cryptographic hashing to demonstrate non-tampering;
- Metadata preservation (creation dates, modification history);
- Third-party custody where appropriate (legal counsel, trusted repositories);
- Compliance with forensic preservation standards (NIST guidelines where applicable).

### 4.4 Privacy and Redaction

Documentation aspires to protect:
- Personal identifying information of third parties not directly relevant;
- Information that could endanger others if disclosed;
- Privileged communications (attorney-client, where applicable);
- Information subject to legitimate confidentiality concerns.

Redaction should preserve evidentiary value while protecting legitimate privacy interests.

---

## Article V: Authorities and Effects

### 5.1 Moral and Philosophical Authority

This Instrument aspires to establish:
- **Moral Standing**: Basis for asserting that compliance is conditional cooperation, not unconditional endorsement;
- **Conscience Documentation**: Record of ethical position regarding institutional legitimacy;
- **Anticipatory Vindication**: Positioning for potential future recognition if institutional failures become more widely acknowledged;
- **Historical Accountability**: Creating record that institutional failures were recognized and objected to contemporaneously.

### 5.2 Evidentiary Relevance and Severe Limitations

**Speculative Evidentiary Relevance**:

While this Instrument creates no legal immunity, the documentary record might be potentially relevant in certain narrow contexts. However, Declarants must understand that courts have historically been very reluctant to admit such documentary evidence and have imposed severe limitations on its use.

Possible (but not guaranteed) contexts where documentation might be considered:
- **Diminished Culpability Arguments**: Demonstrating good-faith belief in institutional illegitimacy (admitted only if relevant to recognized defense elements; courts may exclude as prejudicial or irrelevant);
- **Selective Enforcement Defenses**: Showing disparate treatment (requires prima facie showing that similarly situated persons were not prosecuted AND discriminatory intent; very high evidentiary burden; often insulated by prosecutorial immunity);
- **Jury Nullification Context**: Providing juries with documented basis (courts routinely prohibit defense-initiated materials encouraging jury nullification; likely to be excluded);
- **Civil Disobedience Cases**: Establishing conscience-based motivation (may be relevant but must comply with ordinary evidence rules on relevance, authentication, hearsay);
- **Historical Vindication**: Creating record for potential future recognition.

**Critical Limitations and Warnings**:

1. **Courts Generally Reject Conscience-Based Justifications**: Courts treat conscience statements as evidentiary or persuasive material about motive and belief, NOT as self-executing defenses. Unless a statutory or constitutional protection applies, such declarations are relevant to but not determinative of legal outcomes.

2. **Jury Nullification Materials Routinely Excluded**: Courts prohibit defense-initiated efforts to present documents or instructions that directly encourage jury nullification, treating such materials as improper argument outside the judge's instructions.

3. **Selective Enforcement Defense Faces High Barriers**: Federal courts require showing (1) similarly situated others not prosecuted AND (2) prosecution based on impermissible factor. Documentary evidence (internal memos, charging emails) may be insulated by prosecutorial immunity or work-product protections.

4. **Ordinary Evidentiary Rules Apply**: Documents that are hearsay, unauthenticated, or more prejudicial than probative will be excluded even if expressing moral arguments. Courts weigh probative value against unfair prejudice when conscience-based materials are emotionally charged.

5. **Potential Negative Uses**: This documentation could be used AGAINST Declarant as:
   - Evidence of intent in criminal prosecutions;
   - Demonstration of willfulness rather than good-faith mistake;
   - Characterization as hostile to legal authority generally;
   - Basis for enhanced surveillance or scrutiny;
   - Support for denial of discretionary benefits.

6. **No Guarantee of Any Legal Effect**: Evidentiary relevance is entirely speculative. Courts may exclude this documentation entirely. This Instrument acknowledges legal jeopardy while documenting ethical position.

The Declarant must weigh these severe limitations and potential risks against the benefits of documentation.

### 5.3 No Authorization of Illegality

This Instrument does **not**:
- Authorize violation of law;
- Create legal immunity or protection;
- Establish enforceable defense to criminal or civil liability;
- Replace need for legal counsel;
- Guarantee any particular legal outcome.

The Declarant acknowledges that conditional legitimacy is a **moral and philosophical position**, not a legal trump card. Consequences of non-compliance with law may follow regardless of conditionality documentation.

### 5.4 Relationship to Legal Process

This Instrument aspires to preserve Declarant's full engagement with legal process:
- Compelled disclosure: Declarant must comply with valid subpoenas, discovery requests, and court orders regarding documentation;
- Legal representation: This Instrument is not substitute for legal counsel;
- Good-faith legal proceedings: Declarant remains subject to legal process and court jurisdiction;
- No obstruction: Documentation does not justify obstruction of justice or interference with lawful process.

---

## Article VI: Ethical Constraints

### 6.1 Truthfulness Obligation

The Declarant aspires to:
- Document only truthful, accurate information;
- Correct any discovered errors in documentation;
- Not fabricate or exaggerate institutional failures;
- Acknowledge institutional good-faith efforts where they occur;
- Maintain intellectual honesty in characterizing events.

Knowingly false documentation violates the foundational integrity of this Instrument and undermines its moral force.

### 6.2 Prohibition on Harm to Others

This Instrument does not authorize:
- Violence or physical harm;
- Destruction of property;
- Interference with rights of others;
- Creation of new harms while objecting to institutional harms;
- Retaliation against individuals for performing institutional roles.

Conditionality of legitimacy does not justify harming others. The Declarant's ethical position must be expressed through lawful means or through acceptance of legal consequences for conscience-based civil disobedience.

### 6.3 Proportionality and Specificity

The Declarant aspires to:
- Limit conditionality to institutions and authorities connected to documented failures;
- Ensure degree of conditionality is proportional to severity and pattern of failures;
- Not assert blanket rejection of all legal authority based on select failures;
- Specify particular laws, regulations, or directives subject to conditionality;
- Maintain proportionality between institutional failure and conditionality asserted.

Disproportionate or overbroad conditionality claims undermine the Instrument's moral coherence.

### 6.4 Good-Faith Institutional Engagement

The Declarant aspires to:
- Genuinely attempt remedy through available institutional channels before declaration;
- Provide institutions with meaningful opportunity to address failures;
- Acknowledge institutional reforms when they occur;
- Not use conditionality as pretext for avoiding legitimate obligations;
- Maintain willingness to resume unconditional cooperation if institutions remedy failures.

This Instrument is not a tool for evading legitimate obligations but a framework for articulating conditionality when institutions fail their own standards.

### 6.5 Sunset Upon Remedy

Conditional legitimacy aspires to dissolve when:
- Subject Institution remedies documented failures;
- Institutional reforms address the Performance Criteria deficiencies;
- Alternative remedies become available;
- Pattern of failures demonstrably ends;
- Proportionality no longer supports conditionality.

The goal is institutional accountability and performance, not permanent antagonism. Conditionality should track institutional performance.

---

## Article VII: Sunset and Remedy Provisions

### 7.1 Automatic Sunset Conditions and Performance Metrics

Drawing from state regulatory sunset review practices (e.g., Texas Sunset Act §325.012), this declaration of conditional legitimacy aspires to automatically terminate when documented evidence demonstrates institutional performance improvement.

**Sunset Triggers** (this declaration terminates when any of the following occurs):

1. **Institutional Remedy**: Subject Institution demonstrates sustained compliance with Performance Criteria through:
   - Documented evidence of institutional reforms addressing identified failures;
   - Measurable indicators of improved performance (case processing times, complaint response rates, rights-protection metrics specific to the documented violations);
   - Sustained period (recommended: at least 12 months) without recurrence of Degradation Events;
   - Retrospective review showing goal achievement and remedy effectiveness.

2. **Alternative Remedy**: Effective alternative remedies become available for addressing institutional failures, including:
   - Legislative reforms correcting systemic issues;
   - Judicial precedents establishing accountability for documented violations;
   - Administrative oversight mechanisms becoming operational;
   - Other external accountability measures rendering conditionality unnecessary.

3. **Pattern Break**: Documented pattern of failures ends and institutional good-faith performance is demonstrated through:
   - Quantifiable metrics showing elimination of systematic violations;
   - Evidence of institutional culture shift toward rights protection;
   - Accountability measures for past violations implemented;
   - Credible commitment to sustained performance (not temporary compliance).

4. **Disproportionality**: Changed circumstances render conditionality disproportionate to ongoing failures:
   - Severity of ongoing violations diminished relative to initial declaration;
   - Scope of failures narrowed significantly;
   - Proportionality assessment no longer supports degree of conditionality asserted.

**Performance Evaluation Framework**:

The Declarant aspires to conduct annual reviews assessing whether sunset conditions have been met, evaluating:
- **Efficiency**: Has institution become more effective at protecting rights and meeting obligations?
- **Goal Achievement**: Have specific failures documented in initial declaration been remedied?
- **Duplication Reduction**: Have overlapping or redundant violations ceased?
- **Cost-Benefit**: Does maintaining conditionality serve legitimate accountability purpose or has it become obsolete?
- **Evidence Quality**: Is documentary evidence of improvement credible, sustained, and verifiable?

**Burden of Proof**:

The burden of demonstrating institutional improvement rests with documented evidence, not institutional assurances alone. Mere promises of reform do not trigger sunset; actual, verifiable, sustained performance improvement does.

**Transition and Wind-Down**:

If sunset conditions are met, the Declarant may:
- Voluntarily withdraw declaration with documented reasons;
- Maintain declaration in archived form noting institutional improvement;
- Partially sunset (narrow scope of conditionality) while maintaining declaration for unresolved failures.

A transition period (recommended: 90 days) allows monitoring to ensure improvements are sustained before final sunset.

### 7.2 Voluntary Withdrawal

The Declarant may voluntarily withdraw this declaration when:
- Declarant determines institutional performance has improved sufficiently;
- Declarant concludes conditionality no longer serves legitimate purpose;
- Changed circumstances render declaration no longer appropriate.

Withdrawal should be documented with same care as initial declaration.

### 7.3 Transfer and Succession

This Instrument's documentation may be:
- Transferred to legal counsel for preservation;
- Designated to trusted third parties for custody if Declarant becomes unavailable;
- Incorporated into historical records for future accountability;
- Shared with others documenting similar institutional failures (subject to Declarant's discretion).

### 7.4 Limitation Period

Conditionality declarations should be periodically reviewed (annually recommended) to assess:
- Whether documented failures remain active and unaddressed;
- Whether proportionality still supports degree of conditionality asserted;
- Whether institutional reforms warrant modification or withdrawal;
- Whether scope of conditionality should be narrowed or expanded based on new evidence.

Stale conditionality declarations that no longer track current institutional performance should be updated or withdrawn.

---

## Article VIII: Execution and Notification

### 8.1 Signature and Effective Date

This Instrument becomes effective upon signature by the Declarant:

**Signature**: ___________________________
**Printed Name**: ___________________________
**Date**: ___________________________

**Witness** (optional but recommended):
**Signature**: ___________________________
**Printed Name**: ___________________________
**Date**: ___________________________

### 8.2 Notification to Subject Institutions (Optional)

The Declarant may, but is not required to, provide notification to Subject Institution(s) of this declaration. Notification considerations:

**Arguments for Notification**:
- Provides institutions with opportunity to respond to documented failures;
- Demonstrates good faith and transparency;
- Creates formal record of institutional awareness;
- May prompt institutional reforms.

**Arguments Against Notification**:
- May invite retaliation or targeting;
- Provides institutions advance warning if Declarant facing legal consequences;
- No obligation to notify institutions of one's private ethical positions;
- Documentation stands regardless of institutional awareness.

The decision whether to notify is within Declarant's discretion based on circumstances.

### 8.3 Legal Consultation Recommended

Before executing this Instrument, Declarant is strongly encouraged to:
- Consult qualified legal counsel about potential legal consequences;
- Understand that this is documentary instrument, not legal protection;
- Assess risks of documenting conditional legitimacy position;
- Consider whether to share documentation with legal counsel for privilege protection;
- Evaluate strategic timing of execution and potential notification.

This Instrument does not replace legal advice and creates no attorney-client relationship.

## Commentary

### Theoretical Foundations

#### Social Contract Theory and Consent

The Instrument of Conditional Legitimacy engages fundamentally with social contract theory's premise that governmental authority derives from consent of the governed. Classical theorists (Locke, Rousseau, Rawls) recognized that consent is not unconditional or irrevocable—it depends on governments upholding their end of the bargain.

When institutions systematically fail their foundational obligations while demanding citizen compliance, the asymmetry violates social contract logic. Citizens are asked to uphold obligations while institutions facing no corresponding accountability for non-performance.

This Instrument articulates what social contract theory implies: cooperation with institutions is conditional upon those institutions meeting their own stated obligations. It provides documentary framework for positions that political philosophy recognizes but current legal doctrine often ignores.

#### Performance-Based vs. Status-Based Legitimacy

Contemporary governance often operates on status-based legitimacy: institutions claim authority based on formal position (elected, appointed, constitutional), not performance. Once status is achieved, legitimacy is presumed and citizens must comply regardless of institutional conduct.

This Instrument proposes performance-based legitimacy: authority must be continuously earned through meeting obligations, not merely claimed through status. Institutions that violate their foundational principles while demanding compliance from others engage in hypocrisy that undermines legitimacy claims.

The Instrument does not resolve this tension legally—courts generally enforce status-based legitimacy. But it provides framework for documenting that not everyone accepts this asymmetry, and that some condition their cooperation on institutional performance.

#### The Documentary Function

This is fundamentally a **documentary instrument**. Its power lies not in legal enforceability but in creating contemporaneous record of:
- Recognition that institutional failures exist;
- Refusal to mistake cooperation for endorsement;
- Conditional nature of compliance;
- Ethical and conscience-based position.

Such documentation serves multiple potential functions:
- **Anticipatory vindication**: If institutional failures later become widely recognized, documentary record shows they were acknowledged and objected to contemporaneously;
- **Conscience protection**: Establishes that Declarant's actions or inactions should be understood as conditional cooperation, not unconditional consent;
- **Moral standing**: Provides basis for claiming one occupied ethical position even when legally powerless;
- **Historical accountability**: Creates record for future generations about recognition of institutional failures;
- **Pattern contribution**: Aggregated declarations could demonstrate widespread recognition of institutional legitimacy problems.

#### The Sovereignty Breach and Defensive Posture

**Theoretical Innovation: Institutional Aggression Against Rights**

This Instrument introduces a novel theoretical framework by analogizing institutional rights violations to the concept of aggression in international law. Under the UN Charter (Chapter VII, Article 51), states possess an inherent right to individual or collective self-defense when subjected to armed attack. This right acknowledges that aggression against a sovereign entity creates a defensive posture—a moral and legal justification for protective response proportional to the threat.

The analogy operates as follows:

**In International Law**:
- **Sovereign Entity**: The state
- **Aggression**: Armed attack by another state
- **Breach**: Violation of territorial integrity and political independence
- **Response**: Inherent right to self-defense (proportional and necessary)

**In Constitutional Context**:
- **Sovereign Entity**: The people, source of governmental authority
- **Aggression**: Institutional violations of the rights institutions are constituted to protect
- **Breach**: Sovereignty breach when guardians become aggressors
- **Response**: Defensive posture creating moral foundation for conditional cooperation

When institutions entrusted with protecting constitutional rights instead violate those rights, they commit a form of "aggression" against popular sovereignty. The people vest authority in institutions to secure liberties; when institutions turn that authority against liberties, they breach the compact.

**Not Armed Attack, But Rights Attack**:

This analogy must be carefully bounded. We are not claiming that institutional failures constitute literal armed attacks warranting violent response. Rather, we invoke the *structural logic* of Article 51:
- Aggression creates defensive posture;
- Response must be proportional to threat;
- Victim need not acquiesce to aggression;
- Self-defense is inherent right, not granted permission.

Applied to institutional context:
- Institutional rights-violations create defensive posture for rights-holders;
- Response (conditional cooperation, documentation) must be proportional to violations;
- Citizens need not mistake violations for legitimate authority;
- Conditioning cooperation is inherent right of popular sovereignty, not granted permission.

**Popular Sovereignty as Foundation**:

The United States Constitution opens with "We the People"—acknowledging that governmental authority flows from popular sovereignty. When institutions breach their obligations to the sovereign (the people) by violating the rights they're meant to protect, they commit a sovereignty breach.

This framework provides moral and philosophical foundation for asking: If states can defend against aggression without being labeled rebels or traitors, can citizens articulate defensive posture when institutions aggress against their rights? This Instrument answers: yes, through documentation and conditional cooperation, not violence.

#### Proportionality and Distinction: Borrowing from International Humanitarian Law

**Principles of Jus in Bello Applied to Institutional Accountability**

International humanitarian law (IHL) establishes two critical principles governing lawful conduct during armed conflict:

**1. Proportionality**: Military force used must be proportional to the legitimate military objective. Excessive force, even against legitimate targets, violates proportionality.

**2. Distinction**: Parties must distinguish between combatants and civilians, between military objectives and civilian objects. Attacks must target only legitimate military objectives.

This Instrument adapts these principles to institutional accountability context:

**Proportionality in Conditional Legitimacy**:
- Degree of conditionality asserted must correspond to severity, pattern, and persistence of institutional failures
- Isolated or minor deficiencies do not justify broad conditionality (disproportionate response)
- Systematic and severe violations may warrant substantial declarations (proportionate response)
- Response must not exceed scope of institutional aggression

**Distinction in Conditional Legitimacy**:
- Must distinguish between institutions and individuals
- Must distinguish between systemic failures and isolated acts
- Must distinguish between those responsible for violations and those faithfully executing duties
- Blanket rejection of all legal authority based on specific institutional failures violates distinction

**Preventing Overbroad Application**:

These principles serve critical limiting function. Without proportionality, any institutional failure could justify complete rejection of all authority—clearly disproportionate and dangerous. Without distinction, faithful public servants would be tarred with same brush as violators—clearly unjust and counterproductive.

By borrowing from IHL, this Instrument channels righteous indignation into structured accountability. The defensive posture is not license for indiscriminate resistance, but framework requiring:
- Specific identification of violations
- Proportional response
- Distinction between legitimate and illegitimate exercise of authority
- Good-faith engagement before declaration
- Sunset when violations remedied

**The Moral Logic of Just Defense**:

Just war theory distinguishes *jus ad bellum* (right to go to war) from *jus in bello* (right conduct in war). Even just cause doesn't justify unjust means.

Similarly, this Instrument distinguishes:
- **Right to Declare Conditionality** (*jus ad conditionalitatem*): Institutional failures may create moral foundation for conditional cooperation
- **Right Conduct in Declaration** (*jus in conditionalitate*): Even justified conditionality must be exercised proportionally, with distinction, in good faith

This ensures that defensive posture doesn't become license for disproportionate, overbroad, or bad-faith claims.

### Relationship to Civil Disobedience

Civil disobedience represents action-based expression of conditional legitimacy: willingness to accept legal consequences while refusing to comply with unjust laws or institutional directives. From Thoreau to King to contemporary activists, civil disobedience articulates through action what this Instrument articulates through documentation.

Key relationships:
- **Complementary**: This Instrument provides documentary companion to civil disobedience, articulating the "why" that actions demonstrate;
- **Preparatory**: Documentation of institutional failures and good-faith exhaustion could support diminished culpability arguments in civil disobedience cases;
- **Alternative**: For those unable or unwilling to engage in civil disobedience, this Instrument provides alternative means of articulating conditional legitimacy;
- **Explanatory**: Provides language and framework for conscience-based positions currently expressed only through action.

Critical distinction: Civil disobedience accepts legal consequences while asserting moral righteousness. This Instrument documents ethical position but creates no legal immunity. Both acknowledge law's force while challenging its legitimacy.

### Legal Limitations and Risks

#### No Legal Defense

This Instrument creates no legal defense, immunity, or protection. Courts are unlikely to accept "conditional legitimacy" as justification for non-compliance with law. The Declarant must understand:
- Criminal liability may follow regardless of documented conditionality;
- Civil consequences may attach regardless of conscience-based positions;
- Courts generally enforce status-based rather than performance-based legitimacy;
- Documentation may be used against Declarant as evidence of willful non-compliance;
- No guarantee of jury nullification or diminished culpability findings.

#### Potential Negative Uses

Documentation of conditional legitimacy could be used:
- As evidence of intent in criminal prosecutions;
- To demonstrate willfulness rather than good-faith mistake;
- To characterize Declarant as hostile to legal authority generally;
- As basis for enhanced surveillance or scrutiny;
- To support denial of discretionary benefits (employment, licenses, etc.).

Declarants must weigh these risks against benefits of documentation.

#### Frivolous or Bad-Faith Uses

This Instrument could be misused by:
- Tax protesters seeking to avoid legitimate obligations;
- Sovereign citizens or similar movements claiming to reject governmental authority entirely;
- Bad-faith actors using conditionality as pretext for evasion;
- Those asserting blanket rejection of all laws based on select disagreements.

Such uses violate the Instrument's ethical constraints (specificity, proportionality, good-faith engagement, truthfulness). They undermine the Instrument's moral coherence and legitimate uses.

Quality control depends on:
- Adherence to proportionality and specificity requirements;
- Genuine documentation of institutional failures, not fabricated grievances;
- Good-faith institutional engagement before declaration;
- Willingness to sunset conditionality when institutions reform.

### Relationship to Other Instruments

#### Compact of Mutual Witness

The Compact of Mutual Witness provides infrastructure for documentation, preservation, and testimonial support that could undergird Conditional Legitimacy declarations. Specifically:
- **Evidence Preservation** (Article II.2): Compact Signatories could preserve documentation of institutional failures supporting conditionality claims;
- **Pattern Correlation** (Article IV): Multiple conditional legitimacy declarations could demonstrate patterns;
- **Testimonial Support** (Article III): Compact could provide framework for supporting Declarants facing consequences;
- **Retroactive Custodianship** (Article VI.6): Historical conditional legitimacy positions could be incorporated into preservation network.

#### Declaration of Anticipatory Vindication

Both instruments create documentary records of positions outside current mainstream with expectation of potential future recognition. Conditional Legitimacy is broader (addresses current institutional failures) while Anticipatory Vindication may address positions ahead of their time. They could be executed together where appropriate.

#### Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody

Institutional non-performance that triggers conditional legitimacy may also constitute Degradation Events activating custodial authority under Delegated Rights Custody. The instruments are complementary:
- Conditional Legitimacy articulates moral position;
- Delegated Rights Custody activates authority delegation;
- Both respond to institutional failure, different mechanisms.

#### Registry of Distributed Grievance

Conditional legitimacy declarations could feed into distributed grievance registry, providing:
- Standardized documentation format;
- Aggregation demonstrating patterns;
- Evidence base for future pattern-and-practice claims;
- Historical record of recognized institutional failures.

### Practical Applications

#### Conscientious Objection

While existing conscientious objector status addresses narrow category (military service), this Instrument provides framework for broader conscience-based objections to institutional practices when documented failures support conditionality.

#### Selective Enforcement Defense

When institutions that violate constitutional rights prosecute others for minor violations, conditional legitimacy documentation could support selective enforcement arguments: institutional hypocrisy and disparate treatment undermine prosecution legitimacy.

#### Historical Vindication

Future generations examining current institutional failures may recognize conditional legitimacy declarations as contemporaneous evidence that some recognized problems while institutions denied them. This positions Declarants for historical vindication even when contemporaneous legal vindication unlikely.

#### Diminished Culpability

In jurisdictions allowing jury consideration of motive and intent, documented conditional legitimacy based on institutional failures could support diminished culpability arguments (not legal justification, but contextualization).

#### Institutional Reform Documentation

Aggregated conditional legitimacy declarations could demonstrate that institutional failures are recognized by those affected, creating pressure for reforms and documenting need for change.

### Open Questions and Future Development

#### Legal Recognition

Will any jurisdiction eventually recognize performance-based legitimacy principles, allowing conditional legitimacy documentation to have legal effect? Currently unlikely, but future doctrinal evolution possible.

#### Aggregation Effects

What happens when many individuals execute conditional legitimacy declarations regarding same institutional failures? Does aggregation create moral or political pressure even without legal enforceability?

#### Institutional Responses

How will institutions respond to notification of conditional legitimacy declarations? Ignore? Retaliate? Reform? Reform pressures may depend on volume and visibility.

#### Interaction with Existing Doctrines

How does conditional legitimacy interact with:
- Qualified immunity (institutions immune while demanding citizen compliance);
- Good-faith immunity (institutional actors immune for reasonable mistakes);
- Jury nullification (juries' inherent power to reject unjust applications);
- Conscientious objector status (recognized conscience-based non-compliance categories);
- Selective enforcement doctrine (prosecution hypocrisy as defense).

#### Evolution Through Practice

As people execute this Instrument and potentially face legal proceedings, case law may develop around its evidentiary relevance, if any. Practice may refine understanding of when conditional legitimacy documentation is strategically wise vs. legally risky.
