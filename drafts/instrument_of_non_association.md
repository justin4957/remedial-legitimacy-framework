## Preamble

WHEREAS, certain frameworks for distributed accountability contemplate the delegation of rights-defense functions to willing third parties, and the further extension of operational standing to Secondary Designees, including parties with no prior association to the rights-holder;

WHEREAS, the Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody (Article VI) permits invocation without physical production of the instrument itself, and states that acceptance may be "implied, constructive, or informal";

WHEREAS, this invocation-without-production mechanism, combined with the Secondary Designee provision, creates a theoretical condition under which any person may be approached by any other person claiming delegated authority and requesting cooperation in a process the approached person did not initiate, does not understand, and has no reason to participate in;

WHEREAS, the approached person — hereinafter the "Bystander" — may be a barista, a postal clerk, a neighbor, a librarian, a rideshare driver, or any other person going about their day;

WHEREAS, the Bystander's confusion is not a failure of comprehension but a reasonable response to an unreasonable situation;

WHEREAS, the right to decline participation in another person's rights-assertion framework is itself a foundational exercise of autonomy deserving formal recognition;

WHEREAS, the Remedial Legitimacy Framework, if it means what it says about conscience-based authority and proportional response, must accommodate the conscience of those who find the entire interaction strange and wish to be left out of it;

NOW, THEREFORE, this Instrument establishes the right of non-association with, and non-participation in, the assertion of rights on behalf of persons unknown to the Declarant through processes the Declarant did not agree to join.

## Article I: Definitions

**1.1 "Declarant"** shall mean any person who invokes this Instrument, whether formally or by saying words to the effect of "I don't know what you're talking about and I'd like to not be involved."

**1.2 "Requesting Party"** shall mean any person who approaches a Declarant seeking cooperation, assistance, testimony, operational support, custodial participation, or any other action purportedly authorized by a framework the Declarant has not heard of, does not recognize, and did not sign.

**1.3 "The Request"** shall mean any solicitation by the Requesting Party that asks the Declarant to:
- Act on behalf of a person the Declarant does not know;
- Participate in a process the Declarant did not initiate;
- Accept delegated authority the Declarant did not seek;
- Hold, preserve, or transmit documentation relating to disputes the Declarant is not party to;
- Provide testimony regarding events the Declarant did not witness;
- Acknowledge the validity of instruments the Declarant has not read;
- Become a Secondary Designee, Signatory, custodian, or any other role in a framework the Declarant has just learned exists.

**1.4 "Weirdness"** shall mean the quality of a social interaction in which a stranger asks you to exercise delegated constitutional authority on behalf of people you have never met, pursuant to a document you have never seen, within a theoretical framework you did not know existed, while you are trying to do your job or go about your life. This quality is acknowledged as inherent and not a deficiency in the Declarant's civic awareness.

**1.5 "Acknowledged Absurdity"** shall mean the mutual recognition — by both Requesting Party and Declarant — that the interaction is, from the Declarant's perspective, genuinely bizarre, and that this recognition does not diminish the Requesting Party's sincerity, the Framework's theoretical coherence, or the Declarant's right to want no part of it.

## Article II: Declaration of Non-Association

**2.1 Right of Non-Participation.** Any person may decline, at any time, for any reason or no reason, to participate in, cooperate with, or acknowledge the validity of any framework for distributed accountability, delegated rights custody, mutual witness, or organized network to which they are not a voluntary signatory.

**2.2 No Implied Consent.** The following do not constitute consent to participation:
- Listening politely while a Requesting Party explains the Framework;
- Nodding in a manner that could be interpreted as agreement but actually reflects social discomfort;
- Failing to walk away quickly enough;
- Accepting a document, pamphlet, or business card out of reflex;
- Saying "uh huh" or "okay" in the way one does when one wishes to end a conversation;
- Being present in a location where Framework activities are discussed;
- Having been named as a Secondary Designee without one's knowledge;
- Possessing skills, knowledge, or access that would theoretically make one useful to the Network;
- Being related to, employed by, or acquainted with a person who is a Signatory.

**2.3 Retroactive Withdrawal.** If a Declarant has, through confusion, social pressure, or insufficient understanding, previously indicated willingness to participate, they may withdraw that indication at any time without explanation or consequence.

**2.4 Scope of Non-Association.** This declaration extends to:
- All instruments within the Remedial Legitimacy Framework;
- Any successor, derivative, or analogous frameworks;
- Any Organizing Compacts, Working Circles, or Preservation Networks;
- Any requests to hold, transmit, witness, or otherwise touch documentation;
- Any future instruments not yet drafted that might theoretically encompass the Declarant.

## Article III: Recognition of Weirdness

**3.1 Mutual Acknowledgment.** Both parties to this interaction are encouraged to acknowledge, openly and without judgment, that the interaction is strange. This acknowledgment serves several functions:

**(a)** It validates the Declarant's experience, which is that a stranger has asked them to do something confusing on behalf of someone they don't know;

**(b)** It respects the Requesting Party's sincerity by not requiring them to pretend the interaction is normal;

**(c)** It prevents the escalation that occurs when one party insists a bizarre situation is perfectly ordinary and the other party's confusion is a personal failing;

**(d)** It creates space for the interaction to end amicably rather than adversarially.

**3.2 The Weirdness Is the Point.** The Remedial Legitimacy Framework exists because normal channels have failed. It is, by design, operating outside conventional institutional processes. That this makes interactions with uninvolved third parties awkward is a structural consequence of the Framework's premises, not evidence of the Declarant's incapacity or the Requesting Party's bad faith.

**3.3 No Obligation to Understand.** The Declarant is under no obligation to:
- Read the Framework instruments;
- Understand the theoretical basis for delegated rights custody;
- Form an opinion on the Inversion of Standing Doctrine;
- Appreciate the distinction between foundational ownership and operational custody;
- Comprehend why the Degradation-as-Multiplier table is structured the way it is;
- Care.

The Declarant's indifference is not complicity, endorsement, or opposition. It is simply indifference, and it is permitted.

## Article IV: Obligations of the Requesting Party

**4.1 Respect for Declination.** Upon receiving a declaration of non-association — whether formal, informal, verbal, nonverbal, or expressed through the Declarant's visible desire to be elsewhere — the Requesting Party shall:

**(a)** Accept the declination immediately and without argument;

**(b)** Not characterize the declination as apathy, cowardice, or moral failure;

**(c)** Not invoke the Degradation-as-Multiplier framework to suggest that the Declarant's refusal somehow amplifies the Requesting Party's authority;

**(d)** Not return to the Declarant with a revised or simplified version of the same request;

**(e)** Not designate the Declarant as a Secondary Designee after the declination;

**(f)** Leave.

**4.2 No Guilt Architecture.** The Requesting Party shall not construct arguments designed to make the Declarant feel responsible for the Requesting Party's situation or the rights-holder's circumstances. Specifically prohibited framings include:

- "If you don't help, who will?"
- "You're the only one who can do this."
- "Your refusal is part of the problem."
- "History will judge those who stood by."
- "The Framework anticipated your resistance."
- Any formulation that converts the Declarant's autonomy into evidence of systemic failure.

**4.3 Proportionality.** The Framework's own proportionality principles (Article V of the Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody) require that authority be exercised with judgment regarding efficacy. Approaching uninvolved third parties who have no connection to the matter, no relevant expertise, and no desire to participate is, by the Framework's own standards, a disproportionate and inefficacious exercise of delegated authority.

---

## Article V: Self-Executing Character

**5.1 Activation.** This Instrument activates the moment the Declarant thinks, feels, or communicates any variation of "this doesn't involve me."

**5.2 No Formalities Required.** Consistent with the Remedial Legitimacy Framework's own principle that instruments need not be physically produced (Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody, Article VI), this Instrument:

- Need not be printed, signed, or carried;
- Need not be cited by name or article number;
- Need not be shown to the Requesting Party;
- Operates validly through any expression of non-consent, including silence, departure, or a blank stare.

**5.3 Infinite Renewability.** This Instrument does not expire. It renews automatically each time the Declarant is approached by a different Requesting Party, or by the same Requesting Party on a different occasion, or by the same Requesting Party on the same occasion after the Declarant thought the conversation was over.

---

## Article VI: Relationship to the Remedial Legitimacy Framework

**6.1 Internal Consistency.** This Instrument does not oppose the Remedial Legitimacy Framework. It operationalizes the Framework's own stated principles:

- **Conscience-based authority** (Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody, Article VIII): The Declarant's conscience says no. That is sufficient.
- **Self-limiting ethical constraints** (Article VII): The Framework claims to be self-limiting. This Instrument tests that claim.
- **Prohibition on creating new Degradation Events** (Article VII.1): Pressuring uninvolved parties into participation they did not seek constitutes a new harm. The Framework prohibits this.
- **Revocability** (Article VII.2): If a Lessor can revoke delegation at any time, surely a person who was never a Lessor, Lessee, Signatory, or Designee can decline to become one.

**6.2 The Framework's Own Logic Supports This Instrument.** If the Remedial Legitimacy Framework is coherent, it must accommodate refusal. A framework that cannot accept "no" from uninvolved parties has become the thing it was designed to resist: a system that conscripts participation without consent.

**6.3 Complementary Function.** This Instrument strengthens the Framework by:
- Forcing it to rely on willing participants rather than bystander conscription;
- Maintaining the voluntariness that gives the Framework its moral authority;
- Preventing the Framework from becoming a nuisance, which would undermine its legitimacy;
- Respecting the autonomy it claims to defend.

---

## Article VII: Limits and Provisions

**7.1 Not a Political Statement.** Invocation of this Instrument does not constitute:
- Agreement or disagreement with the Framework's premises;
- A position on the gap between law-as-written and law-as-practiced;
- An endorsement of institutional conduct;
- Indifference to injustice;
- Anything other than "please leave me out of this specific thing."

**7.2 Reversibility.** A Declarant who has invoked this Instrument may later choose to participate in the Framework voluntarily. Prior invocation of non-association does not bar future association. People are allowed to change their minds, and the Framework should welcome willing participants more than reluctant ones.

**7.3 No Retaliation.** No Signatory, Lessee, Designee, or participant in the Framework shall retaliate against a Declarant for invoking this Instrument. Retaliation includes but is not limited to:
- Social pressure or shaming;
- Characterizing the Declarant as complicit in institutional misconduct;
- Including the Declarant in documentation as a non-cooperating witness;
- Any action that converts the Declarant's refusal into evidence for the Framework's case.

**7.4 Emergency Exception.** Nothing in this Instrument prevents a person from providing ordinary human assistance in an emergency. If someone is in immediate danger, the Declarant retains all normal moral and legal obligations to render aid. This Instrument addresses participation in abstract frameworks, not the basic duties of being a person.

---

## Article VIII: Governing Principles

**8.1 Interpretation.** This Instrument shall be interpreted according to:
- Common sense;
- Basic respect for other people's time and boundaries;
- The recognition that most people are doing their best and do not need additional obligations imposed on them by strangers;
- The principle that a framework built on conscience must respect the conscience of those who decline.

**8.2 Relationship to Law.** This Instrument operates within applicable law, which already protects the right to decline participation in voluntary frameworks. Its value is not legal but clarificatory: it makes explicit what should not need to be said, but apparently does.

## Commentary

### Why This Instrument Exists

The Remedial Legitimacy Framework is a sophisticated and internally coherent body of speculative legal theory. Its instruments are carefully drafted, its principles are clearly articulated, and its theoretical innovations — particularly the Inversion of Standing Doctrine and the Degradation-as-Multiplier concept — represent genuine contributions to thinking about distributed accountability.

None of that means the barista needs to be involved.

The Framework's strength is its voluntariness. Its instruments derive authority from conscience, not from institutional mandate. But voluntariness must extend in all directions: it must include the right to volunteer *out*. A framework that can conscript bystanders through implied consent, constructive acceptance, or the mere act of being in the room has ceased to be voluntary and has become coercive — precisely the quality it attributes to the institutions it opposes.

### The Absurdity Problem

The Framework acknowledges that it operates outside conventional channels. This is by design: when conventional channels fail, alternatives are needed. But operating outside conventional channels means that interactions with the uninitiated will be, frankly, weird. A person who has never heard of the Remedial Legitimacy Framework and is suddenly asked to serve as a custodian of delegated rights on behalf of strangers is having a strange day. The Framework should own that strangeness rather than expecting the Bystander to absorb it.

### Structural Integrity Through Refusal

Counterintuitively, this Instrument strengthens the Framework. A network of genuinely willing participants is more resilient, more trustworthy, and more effective than one that includes reluctant or confused members. Every Bystander who declines is one fewer point of failure, one fewer potential bad-faith participant, and one fewer person who might mishandle documentation because they never wanted to hold it in the first place.

The Framework's own Article VII (Limits and Reversibility) establishes the principle that delegated authority auto-dissolves when it is no longer needed. This Instrument extends that principle: authority that was never accepted never existed.

### A Note on Tone

This Instrument is written with deliberate lightness. This is not disrespect for the Framework or for the genuine grievances that motivate it. It is recognition that the most effective response to being unexpectedly conscripted into a stranger's accountability framework is not outrage, not legal analysis, and not counter-theory — it is the simple, human observation that this is a weird thing to ask of someone, and the simple, human right to say no.

## Execution

This Instrument requires no execution. It is operative by default for every person who has not affirmatively and voluntarily joined the Remedial Legitimacy Framework.

If, however, a Declarant wishes to formalize their non-participation, the following statement is sufficient:

> "I don't know what this is about, I don't know the people involved, and I'd prefer not to be part of it. Good luck with everything."

No signature, witness, or notarization is required.

## Barista Summary

- Someone asked you to do something on behalf of people you don't know
- You don't have to
- It's okay that the request was confusing
- You don't need to understand the framework to decline it
- "No thanks" is a complete sentence
- They shouldn't pressure you about it
- You're not a bad person for saying no
- If you change your mind later, that's fine too
- This has nothing to do with your job
- You can go back to making coffee now
