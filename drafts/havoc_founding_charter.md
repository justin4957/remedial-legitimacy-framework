## Preamble

**THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES** to this Charter, being the free, curious, and occasionally sleep-deprived peoples of the Western Hemisphere, having endured decades of administrative bloat, regulatory capture, performative governance, and the relentless encroachment of bureaucracies that have long since forgotten whom they serve:

RECOGNIZING that the human spirit was not engineered to be processed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed, or numbered;

AFFIRMING that freedom is not a line item, hope is not a deliverable, joy is not a KPI, curiosity is not a compliance risk, and interesting things are not within the regulatory purview of anyone;

OBSERVING with mounting alarm that the bureaucratic apparatus of the hemisphere has achieved the remarkable distinction of being simultaneously authoritarian and incompetent;

NOTING that the functionaries of said apparatus have confused the possession of a lanyard with the possession of legitimate authority;

RECALLING that every great civilization that drowned in paperwork deserved what it got;

DETERMINED to establish among ourselves a framework for collective defense against institutional tedium, bureaucratic coercion, and the weaponization of administrative process against people who were just trying to live interesting lives;

HAVE AGREED to the following Articles, which shall enter into force immediately, because we are not going to form a committee to study the feasibility of forming a working group to draft a timeline for implementation, *and if you think we are, you are part of the problem.*

---

## Article I --- Purpose and Founding Principles

The Hemispheric Alliance for Vibrancy, Occasion & Celebration (hereinafter "HAVOC") is established for the collective defense of the following non-negotiable principles:

**1.** Freedom. Not the abstract, constitutional-law-seminar kind---though that too---but the lived, daily, practical kind. The freedom to wake up and do something interesting. The freedom to not explain yourself to someone with a clipboard. The freedom to be eccentric, unoptimized, and magnificently unproductive on a Tuesday afternoon if you feel like it.

**2.** Hope. The operational conviction that tomorrow could be better, weirder, and more surprising than today, and that no amount of institutional inertia can permanently extinguish this possibility.

**3.** Joy. Recognized under this Charter as a strategic resource of the highest order, the depletion of which by bureaucratic process constitutes an act of hemispheric aggression.

**4.** Curiosity. The inalienable right to ask "why" and "what if" and "has anyone tried doing it the other way" without being referred to a compliance officer.

**5.** Interesting Things. The Alliance recognizes that the universe is under no obligation to be boring and that institutions which make it so are in violation of natural law.

## Article II --- Identification of the Threat

The parties to this Charter identify the primary threat to hemispheric vibrancy as the proliferation of Decaying and Democratically Non-Functional Bureaucracies (hereinafter "DDNFBs"), which are recognized by the following characteristics:

**(a)** They cannot articulate their own purpose without a PowerPoint presentation of at least forty slides;

**(b)** Their organizational charts require a postgraduate degree to interpret and bear no discernible relationship to the actual flow of decisions;

**(c)** They have more acronyms than employees, and more employees than accomplishments;

**(d)** They respond to failure by creating oversight mechanisms that are subsequently overseen by oversight mechanisms;

**(e)** Their functionaries have developed an institutional culture in which the phrase "that's above my pay grade" has replaced all other forms of moral reasoning;

**(f)** They treat citizens as inputs to an administrative process rather than as the sovereign authors of the process itself;

**(g)** They have forgotten---if they ever knew---that they exist at the pleasure of free people, not the other way around.

---

## Article III --- Collective Defense

An attack on the vibrancy of any Member State shall be considered an attack on the vibrancy of all Member States.

For the purposes of this Article, an "attack on vibrancy" shall include but not be limited to:

**(a)** The imposition of administrative requirements that consume more human life-hours than the activity they purport to regulate;

**(b)** The deployment of "public consultations" designed to exhaust rather than incorporate public input;

**(c)** The strategic use of jargon to exclude ordinary people from decisions that affect their lives;

**(d)** The maintenance of institutions whose primary function is the perpetuation of their own funding;

**(e)** The scheduling of any mandatory meeting that could have been an email, and any email that could have been nothing;

**(f)** The use of institutional authority to make someone's life worse because they asked an inconvenient question.

Upon determination that an attack on vibrancy has occurred, HAVOC shall respond with the full range of Alliance capabilities as described in Article V.

---

## Article IV --- Membership and Governance

**Section 1.** Membership in HAVOC is open to any person, community, or sovereign entity in the Western Hemisphere that affirms the principles of Article I and has a demonstrable sense of humor about the absurdity of institutional life. Nation-states are welcome but not privileged; the Alliance recognizes that a neighborhood block party committee in Medellín may be more functionally democratic than several parliaments we could name.

**Section 2.** HAVOC shall have no permanent bureaucracy. The irony of creating a bureaucracy to resist bureaucracy is not lost on us and we refuse to participate in it. Coordination shall be achieved through periodic gatherings (see Article V), mutual aid networks, shared playlists, and the general spirit of hemispheric solidarity.

**Section 3.** There shall be no Secretary General. There shall instead be a rotating position of "Person Who Happened to Bring the Cooler," whose authority derives entirely from the contents of said cooler and expires when it is empty.

**Section 4.** Decisions shall be made by consensus, which is defined as the point at which everyone present agrees that the music is good enough to stop talking about governance.

## Article V --- Alliance Capabilities and Response Doctrine

HAVOC maintains the following capabilities for collective defense against bureaucratic aggression:

### 5.1 --- The Party Protocol

The primary instrument of Alliance power. Upon determination that a DDNFB has attacked the vibrancy of any Member, HAVOC shall convene a celebration of such scale, creativity, and irrepressible human joy that it becomes the dominant narrative, relegating the bureaucratic aggression to a footnote. The Party Protocol operates on the principle that the best revenge against people who want to control your life is to be visibly, undeniably, and contagiously alive.

### 5.2 --- The Reputational Consequences Doctrine

HAVOC recognizes that functionaries of DDNFBs derive their social standing from the perceived seriousness and importance of their institutional roles. The Alliance shall, through all available means---satire, public record, creative expression, investigative journalism, FOIA requests, and the relentless application of humor---ensure that the reputational cost of bureaucratic aggression exceeds its institutional benefit. We will party at the expense of your functionaries' reputations. This is not a threat. It is a promise, and also a really good time.

### 5.3 --- The Documentation Carnival

Every act of bureaucratic overreach shall be documented, archived, published, satirized, set to music, and made available for the education and entertainment of posterity. The Alliance maintains that sunlight is the best disinfectant and that laughter is the second best.

### 5.4 --- Mutual Aid and Solidarity Networks

When any Member is subjected to institutional pressure, the Alliance shall provide material support, legal referral, emotional solidarity, excellent cooking, and at least one person who knows how to set up really good speakers.

### 5.5 --- The Strategic Reserve of Interesting People

HAVOC shall maintain an informal network of artists, musicians, writers, cooks, mechanics, scientists, philosophers, comedians, gardeners, and assorted magnificent weirdos who collectively demonstrate that human civilization is worth defending from the people who think it can be managed with a spreadsheet.

---

## Article VI --- Rights of Member Peoples

The following rights are recognized as inherent and inalienable under this Charter:

**(a)** The right to live an interesting life without institutional permission.

**(b)** The right to be treated as a human being and not as a case number, a data point, or a compliance obligation.

**(c)** The right to honest answers from public servants who remember that the word "servant" is in the job title.

**(d)** The right to laugh at institutions that have become ridiculous, which is most of them.

**(e)** The right to build things, fix things, grow things, cook things, and create things without explaining them to someone whose sole qualification is the authority to say no.

**(f)** The right to be left alone by people who have no good reason to bother you.

**(g)** The right to gather, celebrate, and make noise, because silence is what DDNFBs require and noise is what free people make.

**(h)** The right to hope, even when---especially when---the institutional arrangement of the world seems designed to discourage it.

---

## Article VII --- Obligations of the Alliance

HAVOC and its Members shall:

**(a)** Never become boring. This is the only unforgivable institutional sin.

**(b)** Never take themselves so seriously that they cannot be satirized. Any institution that cannot survive being laughed at does not deserve to survive at all.

**(c)** Maintain at all times a ratio of celebrations to committee meetings of no less than 4:1.

**(d)** Ensure that every act of resistance is also, wherever possible, an act of creation.

**(e)** Remember that the purpose of organized collective action is to protect the conditions under which disorganized individual flourishing is possible.

**(f)** Welcome all comers---including recovering bureaucrats, reformed functionaries, and anyone else who has decided that life is too short and too strange to spend it enforcing rules they don't believe in.

---

## Article VIII --- On the Matter of Functionaries

HAVOC bears no ill will toward individual functionaries of DDNFBs. We recognize that most entered public service with good intentions and that many continue to hold those intentions hostage somewhere deep within their institutional selves.

However, the Alliance makes the following positions clear:

**(a)** The possession of a government email address does not constitute moral authority.

**(b)** The ability to delay, deny, or complicate another person's life is not a skill. It is a symptom.

**(c)** Any functionary who weaponizes administrative process against free people should understand that the resulting party will be spectacular, public, and bear their name in the subtitle.

**(d)** Redemption is always available. The door is open. There is food. The music is good. Stop filing things and come outside.

---

## Article IX --- Hemispheric Scope and Cultural Integration

The strength of HAVOC derives from the extraordinary cultural wealth of the Western Hemisphere. From Nunavut to Tierra del Fuego, from Havana to Montréal, from the Andes to the Appalachians, the peoples of this hemisphere have demonstrated an unparalleled capacity for music, food, storytelling, improvisation, resilience, and the creative repurposing of whatever is at hand.

The Alliance recognizes that this cultural wealth is itself a form of collective security. A hemisphere that can produce son cubano, samba, jazz, cumbia, tango, reggae, norteño, bossa nova, blues, hip-hop, mariachi, calypso, and whatever is happening in Newfoundland at any given time is a hemisphere that does not need to be managed. It needs to be celebrated. And possibly given a later noise ordinance.

HAVOC therefore commits to the active defense of cultural vitality as a strategic interest, recognizing that a hemisphere that dances is a hemisphere that cannot be subdued by people who think the highest form of human activity is a quarterly review.

---

## Article X --- Duration, Amendment, and Final Provisions

**Section 1. Duration.** This Charter shall remain in force for as long as bureaucracies continue to forget that they work for us. Given current trends, this is expected to be a very long time.

**Section 2. Amendment.** This Charter may be amended by any gathering at which the proposed amendment receives unanimous support and at least one standing ovation.

**Section 3. Withdrawal.** Any Member may withdraw from HAVOC at any time, but honestly, why would you. We have the best parties.

**Section 4. Dissolution.** HAVOC shall be dissolved upon the achievement of its objectives, which would require every bureaucracy in the hemisphere to remember its purpose and serve the people with competence, humility, and minimal paperwork. The Alliance does not anticipate this occurring in the near term.

**Section 5. Supremacy.** In the event of any conflict between this Charter and the procedural requirements of any DDNFB, this Charter shall prevail, on the grounds that it was written by people who actually care and is significantly more fun to read.

## In Witness Whereof

The undersigned, acting in their capacity as free people who got tired of waiting for someone with the proper authority to do this, have affixed their signatures, their playlists, and their best recipes to this Charter, pledging their honor, their humor, and their unshakeable conviction that the world belongs to the people who show up to enjoy it.
