## Prefatory Note on Legal Philosophy

This Treaty is grounded in the tradition of social contract theory as articulated by Locke, Rousseau, and their intellectual descendants, and as codified in the foundational instruments of international human rights law--including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), and regional conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights (1950) and the American Convention on Human Rights (1969).

It proceeds from a premise that is not radical but axiomatic in democratic political theory: that legitimate governmental authority derives from the consent of the governed, and that this consent is conditional upon the ongoing fulfillment of reciprocal obligations by the state.

This Treaty is explicitly **not** an instrument of individual legal exemption. It does not assert that any person may unilaterally exempt themselves from duly enacted laws, refuse to participate in lawful civic obligations, or declare personal sovereignty in opposition to a functioning constitutional order. Such claims--characteristic of so-called "sovereign citizen" movements--rest on pseudolegal foundations that this Treaty categorically repudiates. The distinction is fundamental:

- **Sovereign citizen ideology** asserts that the individual stands above or outside the legal order by personal declaration, without institutional process or collective accountability.
- **This Treaty** asserts that governments stand within the legal order by virtue of their obligations to their citizens, and that when governments systematically breach those obligations, citizens retain the collective right to demand accountability through structured, transparent, and lawful mechanisms.

The analytical framework employed here draws on the right of revolution as articulated in the American Declaration of Independence, the accountability mechanisms of international humanitarian law, the doctrine of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) as endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 2005, and the extensive body of jurisprudence on state obligations under human rights treaties. It is a framework of structured collective accountability, not individual legal escapism.

The Treaty's modalities of consent and adherence are adapted from the general principles of treaty law as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969), while recognizing that this instrument operates among natural persons and civic associations rather than among states. In particular, the Treaty adopts the Vienna Convention's emphasis on good-faith performance, the centrality of consent to be bound, and the primacy of the Treaty's object and purpose in any interpretive exercise--while adapting the mechanics of ratification to the non-state character of its Parties through a framework of normative ratification by practice, as set forth in Article 15.

## Preamble

The Parties to this Treaty,

**Reaffirming** their adherence to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the body of international law recognizing the inherent dignity, equal rights, and inalienable freedoms of all persons;

**Acknowledging** that the legitimacy of governmental authority derives from the free and informed consent of the governed, as expressed through constitutional order, democratic institutions, and the ongoing practice of accountable governance;

**Recognizing** that the relationship between a government and its citizens constitutes a reciprocal compact--that the grant of authority carries correlative obligations of transparency, due process, proportional restraint, and fidelity to the terms under which consent was given;

**Observing** that, throughout human history, governments have at times systematically breached these obligations through coercion, deception, arbitrary surveillance, suppression of dissent, or collusion with external powers against the interests of their own populations;

**Affirming** that when such breaches become systemic and sustained, the compact upon which governmental legitimacy rests is materially impaired, and that citizens are not only entitled but obligated to demand redress through collective, peaceful, and lawful means;

**Conscious** that the interpretation and application of this Treaty shall, in accordance with general principles of treaty law, be guided by its text, including this preamble, and by its object and purpose as set forth herein;

**Mindful** of the general principles reflected in the contemporary law of treaties, including good-faith performance, the centrality of consent to be bound, and the primacy of the Treaty's object and purpose in any interpretive exercise;

**Recognizing**, however, that this instrument constitutes a framework convention among natural persons and civic associations rather than among States, and that its modalities of consent, adherence, and performance are necessarily adapted to that character;

**Desiring** therefore to establish clear conditions under which individuals and civic entities may be deemed to have accepted and to be bound by the normative commitments of this Treaty through their conduct in a shared context of practice, even in the absence of formal signature or ratification in the inter-state sense;

**Determined** to create a framework of mutual assurance by which individuals, acting collectively and through transparent institutional processes, may hold their governments accountable to the terms of the compact and support one another in the defense of shared principles;

**Emphasizing** that this Treaty operates within and in support of the international legal order, not in opposition to it, and that it is designed to strengthen the accountability mechanisms upon which democratic governance depends;

**Have agreed as follows**, it being understood that consent to be bound by this Treaty may be expressed either by formal act of endorsement or by sustained adherence to, and invocation of, its normative framework in a shared context of practice, as further specified in Article 15;

---

## Part I: Foundations and Principles

### Article 1 -- Purpose and Scope

1. This Treaty establishes a framework of mutual assurance among its Parties for the collective defense of consent-based governance, the rule of law, and the reciprocal obligations that bind governments to their citizens.

2. The Treaty is designed to operate within the international legal order and in complementarity with existing national constitutional protections, international human rights instruments, and mechanisms of democratic accountability.

3. Nothing in this Treaty shall be construed to authorize any Party to unilaterally exempt themselves from duly enacted laws, refuse participation in lawful civic obligations, evade legitimate taxation, or assert personal jurisdiction in opposition to a functioning constitutional order. Such claims are inconsistent with the principles of this Treaty.

4. The Treaty addresses the conduct of governmental and institutional actors, not the status of individual persons under law. Its mechanisms are collective, procedural, and institutional in character.

### Article 2 -- Foundational Principles

The Parties affirm the following principles as the foundation of this Treaty:

1. **Conditional Consent.** Legitimate governmental authority is grounded in the free and informed consent of the governed. This consent is not a one-time event but an ongoing condition, maintained through the government's fulfillment of its constitutional and legal obligations.

2. **Reciprocal Obligation.** The relationship between a government and its citizens is one of mutual obligation. The grant of authority by the citizenry carries correlative duties of transparency, due process, proportional restraint, and accountability.

3. **Collective Accountability.** When governmental conduct systematically breaches the terms of the civic compact, the right and duty of citizens to demand redress is exercised collectively through structured processes, not through individual declaration.

4. **Rule of Law.** This Treaty operates within and in support of the rule of law, understood as the principle that governmental power is exercised according to publicly known, prospectively enacted, and impartially enforced standards.

5. **Peaceful Means.** All actions taken under this Treaty shall employ peaceful, lawful, and proportionate means. The Treaty does not authorize or encourage the use of force.

6. **Subsidiarity.** Redress should be sought first through domestic constitutional mechanisms, then through regional and international instruments, before invoking the collective mechanisms established by this Treaty.

### Article 3 -- Relationship to Existing Legal Order

1. This Treaty is complementary to, and does not supersede, the domestic constitutional order of any state that operates in accordance with the principles set forth in Article 2.

2. The Parties recognize the validity and importance of international human rights law, international humanitarian law, and the institutional framework of the United Nations.

3. Nothing in this Treaty diminishes or modifies the legal obligations of states under existing treaties, conventions, or customary international law.

4. The Parties acknowledge that democratic governance is imperfect and that policy disagreement, political loss, or dissatisfaction with particular governmental decisions does not, by itself, constitute a breach of the civic compact as understood by this Treaty.

---

## Part II: Obligations and Cooperation

### Article 4 -- Obligations of the Parties

1. Each Party undertakes to respect and support the principles set forth in this Treaty, and to act in good faith toward other Parties and toward the institutions established hereunder.

2. Each Party undertakes to maintain the capacity and readiness to assist other Parties through lawful means, including but not limited to: advocacy, legal assistance, secure communication, information sharing, and coordination of peaceful collective action.

3. Each Party undertakes to refrain from actions that would undermine the purposes of this Treaty, including collusion with governmental actors engaged in systematic breaches of the civic compact.

4. Each Party acknowledges that membership in this Treaty does not exempt them from any lawful obligation under their domestic legal order, and that the protections of this Treaty are activated only through the collective and institutional processes described herein.

### Article 5 -- Cooperation and Mutual Development

The Parties will contribute to the resilience and effectiveness of consent-based governance by:

1. Strengthening individual and collective capacities for civic participation, legal literacy, and informed consent;

2. Promoting open and secure exchange of information relevant to governmental accountability;

3. Supporting civic education, technological literacy, and the development of tools for transparent governance and secure communication;

4. Fostering mutual understanding across cultural, national, and linguistic boundaries while respecting legitimate differences in constitutional traditions.

### Article 6 -- Consultation

1. The Parties shall consult together whenever any Party believes that the sovereignty, liberty, or security of the governed is being systematically undermined by governmental or institutional actors.

2. Consultation may be initiated by any Party through notice to the Council of the Accord established under Article 11.

3. The purpose of consultation is to establish facts, assess the nature and severity of the alleged breach, and determine appropriate collective response in accordance with the graduated framework set forth in Article 8.

---

## Part III: Breach, Determination, and Response

### Article 7 -- Definition and Classification of Breach

1. For the purposes of this Treaty, a governmental authority shall be deemed to have materially breached its compact with the governed when its conduct meets the following cumulative criteria:

   (a) The conduct is systematic, sustained, or structural in character, as distinguished from isolated acts of malfeasance or errors of policy;

   (b) The conduct implicates one or more of the categories enumerated in paragraph 2 of this Article;

   (c) Domestic constitutional mechanisms for redress have been exhausted, are unavailable, or have been rendered ineffective by the very conduct at issue; and

   (d) The conduct is not merely the outcome of legitimate political disagreement, democratic competition, or lawful policy choices within the normal operation of a constitutional order.

2. **Categories of Breach.** The following categories of governmental conduct, when they meet the criteria of paragraph 1, shall constitute material breach:

   (a) **Nullification of Consent.** Systematic suppression of free and fair elections, the franchise, or the institutional mechanisms by which popular consent is expressed and renewed;

   (b) **Abrogation of Due Process.** Systematic denial of fair trial, habeas corpus, or lawful adjudication to the governed, including the operation of extrajudicial detention, rendition, or punishment;

   (c) **Coercive Surveillance.** Mass or targeted surveillance of the governed without lawful authority, proportionate justification, or effective judicial oversight, conducted for the purpose or with the effect of suppressing dissent, chilling protected expression, or facilitating social control;

   (d) **Compelled Allegiance.** Use of force, economic coercion, or legal compulsion to mandate personal fealty to political actors, parties, or ideological positions, as distinguished from lawful civic obligations;

   (e) **External Collusion.** Coordinated action with foreign governments, transnational entities, or non-state actors to override the constitutional rights and interests of the governed;

   (f) **Institutional Capture.** Systematic subordination of independent judicial, legislative, regulatory, or oversight institutions to executive or partisan control, rendering accountability mechanisms inoperative.

3. **Standard of Evidence.** A determination of material breach shall require clear and convincing evidence, assessed according to the evidentiary standards and procedures established by the Council of the Accord under Article 12.

4. **Distinction from Policy Disagreement.** The following, standing alone, do not constitute material breach: unfavorable electoral outcomes; lawful policy choices with which the Parties disagree; incremental erosion of preferred political positions through democratic processes; or the exercise of lawful governmental authority, even when the exercise is controversial.

### Article 8 -- Graduated Response Framework

Collective action under this Treaty shall follow a graduated framework of response, escalating in proportion to the severity and persistence of the breach:

1. **Level 1 -- Observation and Documentation.** Upon receipt of a consultation request under Article 6, the Council shall initiate fact-finding, documentation, and monitoring of the alleged breach. This level requires a simple majority of the Council.

2. **Level 2 -- Formal Inquiry and Report.** If preliminary evidence supports the allegation, the Council shall authorize a formal inquiry, appoint independent investigators, and issue a public report of findings. This level requires a two-thirds majority of the Council.

3. **Level 3 -- Collective Advocacy.** If the formal inquiry finds clear and convincing evidence of material breach, the Council may authorize collective action including: coordinated advocacy before international bodies; support for domestic legal challenges; public information campaigns; diplomatic engagement; and coordination with relevant NGOs and international institutions. This level requires a two-thirds majority of the Council.

4. **Level 4 -- Formal Determination of Breach.** In cases of severe and continuing breach, the Council may issue a Formal Determination that the governmental authority in question has materially breached its compact with the governed. A Formal Determination shall trigger the full mutual assurance obligations of Article 9. This level requires a three-fourths supermajority of the Council and ratification by the Assembly of Parties.

5. **De-escalation.** The Council shall continuously assess whether conditions warrant de-escalation, and shall reduce the response level when the evidence supports such reduction.

### Article 9 -- Mutual Assurance

1. Upon a Formal Determination of Breach under Article 8(4), the Parties agree that a systematic attack against the rights and autonomy of the governed within the subject jurisdiction shall be considered an attack against the principles upheld by all Parties.

2. Consequently, each Party agrees to assist the affected population by such peaceful means as are within their capacity, which may include:

   (a) Legal assistance and coordination of constitutional challenges;

   (b) Secure communication support and information protection;

   (c) Advocacy before national courts, international tribunals, and relevant treaty bodies;

   (d) Coordination of peaceful public response and civic mobilization;

   (e) Economic support for displaced, persecuted, or disenfranchised persons;

   (f) Engagement with international organizations, diplomatic missions, and press freedom organizations.

3. No action taken under this Article shall employ or encourage the use of force, nor shall any action violate the domestic laws of jurisdictions in which the Parties operate, except insofar as those laws are themselves the subject of the Formal Determination of Breach.

4. Actions under this Article shall be coordinated through the Council of the Accord and subject to periodic review and accountability.

### Article 10 -- Safeguards Against Abuse

1. The following safeguards shall apply to all proceedings under this Treaty:

   (a) **Burden of Proof.** The burden of establishing material breach lies with the Party or Parties alleging it, and shall be assessed against the clear and convincing evidence standard;

   (b) **Right of Response.** Any governmental authority that is the subject of proceedings shall have notice of the proceeding and a meaningful opportunity to respond, either directly or through designated representatives;

   (c) **Independent Review.** Fact-finding and formal inquiries shall be conducted by independent investigators who have no personal interest in the outcome;

   (d) **Transparency.** All findings, reports, and determinations shall be made publicly available, except where publication would endanger the safety of persons;

   (e) **Proportionality.** Collective action shall be proportionate to the nature and severity of the breach, and shall be directed at accountability and restoration rather than punishment;

   (f) **Prohibition on Self-Dealing.** No Party may invoke the mechanisms of this Treaty for personal financial gain, to evade lawful obligations unrelated to the alleged breach, or to pursue disputes that are properly cognizable in domestic courts;

   (g) **Periodic Audit.** The Council shall undergo periodic external audit of its proceedings, finances, and determinations, with results made publicly available.

## Part V: Consent, Accession, and General Provisions

### Article 15 -- Consent to be Bound and Normative Ratification

1. **General Principle.** For the purposes of this Treaty, "consent to be bound" shall be understood, *mutatis mutandis*, in accordance with general principles of treaty law, adapted to the non-state character of the Parties. Where the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides for consent through signature, ratification, acceptance, approval, or accession by states, this Treaty provides for consent through the means set forth in this Article.

2. **Modes of Consent.** A person or civic entity shall be deemed a Party to this Treaty when, in a manner reasonably accessible to other Parties, they:

   (a) **Formal Endorsement.** Explicitly endorse the Treaty or an officially maintained text thereof through written declaration, digital signature, or other verifiable act of assent deposited with the Council; or

   (b) **Normative Ratification by Practice.** Sustainably participate in, rely upon, or invoke the procedures, definitions, or assurance mechanisms established by this Treaty in a shared context of practice with existing Parties.

3. **Indicia of Normative Ratification.** Consent expressed under paragraph 2(b) shall be inferred from a consistent pattern of conduct demonstrating:

   (a) Acceptance of the foundational principles set forth in Article 2, as evidenced by the person's or entity's public statements, conduct, or institutional practice;

   (b) Reliance upon the Treaty's procedures or determinations in framing claims, defenses, or collective actions, whether in legal proceedings, public advocacy, or institutional governance;

   (c) Willingness to be subject to the safeguards, evidentiary standards, and accountability mechanisms established in Articles 7 through 14, as demonstrated by participation in or deference to such proceedings; and

   (d) Engagement with existing Parties in a manner consistent with the obligations of good faith and mutual assurance set forth in Article 4.

4. **Inter Se Character.** Acceptance under this Article is internal and reciprocal: it operates only *inter se* among persons and entities who have themselves so consented, and does not purport to create obligations for any third party who has not so consented. No person or entity may be deemed a Party against their express disavowal.

5. **Register of Parties.** The Council shall maintain a public register of Parties, indicating, where applicable, whether consent was expressed by formal declaration under paragraph 2(a) or inferred from practice under paragraph 2(b). The absence of an entry shall not, by itself, preclude a finding that consent has been validly expressed under paragraph 2(b), where clear evidence of sustained practice exists.

6. **Temporal Determination.** In cases of normative ratification under paragraph 2(b), the date of accession shall be the date on which the Council determines that the conditions of sustained practice were first met. The Council shall establish, by supplementary protocol, minimum durational thresholds for what constitutes "sustained" practice, which shall not be less than six months of consistent conduct.

7. **Challenge and Review.** Any Party may challenge the Council's determination of normative ratification, whether affirmative or negative, by petition to the Assembly of Parties under Article 13(2)(f). Such challenges shall be resolved by simple majority vote of the Assembly.

8. **Limitations and Safeguards.** Nothing in this Article shall be construed to:

   (a) Create or imply any obligation for States under public international law;

   (b) Confer, modify, or extinguish any status or capacity recognized under domestic legal systems;

   (c) Override the principle that no person may claim, solely by reference to this Treaty, exemption from generally applicable laws of a functioning constitutional order;

   (d) Deem any person a Party who has expressly and publicly disclaimed adherence to this Treaty, regardless of the pattern of their conduct; or

   (e) Permit the Council or any Party to assert jurisdiction over, or impose obligations upon, any natural or legal person who has not consented to be bound under the terms of this Article.

9. **Good-Faith Interpretation.** The provisions of this Article shall be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to their terms in their context and in light of the Treaty's object and purpose, consistent with the general rule of interpretation reflected in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.

### Article 16 -- Accession

1. Any individual who subscribes to the principles of this Treaty and undertakes to fulfill its obligations may apply for accession through formal endorsement under Article 15(2)(a).

2. Accession by formal endorsement shall be effective upon approval by the Assembly of Parties in accordance with procedures established by supplementary protocol.

3. For the avoidance of doubt, accession may also be established by normative ratification under Article 15(2)(b). In such cases, the date of accession shall be determined in accordance with Article 15(6).

4. Accession to this Treaty, whether by formal endorsement or normative ratification, does not alter the legal status of any person under their domestic legal order. No Party may represent that membership confers legal immunities, jurisdictional exemptions, or special status under any domestic or international law.

### Article 17 -- Peaceful Coexistence

1. Nothing in this Treaty shall conflict with genuine and voluntary loyalty to a government that honors the principles set forth herein.

2. The Parties support the peaceful coexistence of this framework with legitimate state authorities that uphold the rule of law, democratic accountability, and the rights of the governed.

3. The Parties recognize that democratic governance admits of many legitimate forms and traditions, and that this Treaty does not prescribe any particular model of government, provided the foundational principles of consent, accountability, and the rule of law are maintained.

### Article 18 -- Non-Imposition and Third-Party Rights

1. Consistent with the principle *pacta tertiis nec nocent nec prosunt* reflected in Article 34 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, this Treaty does not create any rights or obligations for any person, entity, or State that has not consented to be bound under Article 15.

2. The Parties shall not invoke the mechanisms of this Treaty against any person or entity that is not itself a Party, except insofar as the Treaty authorizes collective advocacy directed at governmental authorities in their public capacity.

3. Nothing in this Treaty shall be construed as an assertion that the Parties, individually or collectively, possess attributes of statehood, sovereign immunity, diplomatic status, or international legal personality equivalent to that of States.

### Article 19 -- Amendment

1. Any Party may propose an amendment to this Treaty by submitting it to the Council, which shall circulate it to all Parties.

2. Amendments shall enter into force upon ratification by three-fourths of the Parties, as expressed through the Assembly.

3. No amendment shall alter the foundational principles set forth in Article 2, the safeguards established in Article 10, or the limitations on consent set forth in Article 15(8).

### Article 20 -- Duration and Withdrawal

1. This Treaty shall remain in force indefinitely.

2. Any Party may withdraw from this Treaty by providing written notice to the Council. Withdrawal shall take effect one year after receipt of such notice.

3. A Party who obtained membership through normative ratification under Article 15(2)(b) may withdraw by express written disavowal deposited with the Council, or by a sustained cessation of the conduct from which consent was inferred, subject to determination by the Council.

4. Obligations arising from actions undertaken while a Party, including financial commitments and duties of confidentiality, shall survive withdrawal through their completion.

### Article 21 -- Authentic Text and Custodianship

1. The authentic text of this Treaty shall be maintained in secure digital and physical form by a neutral custodian designated by the Council.

2. Certified copies shall be made available to all Parties and to the public.

3. The Treaty shall be translated into such languages as the Assembly may determine, with all translations being equally authentic upon certification by the Council.

### Article 22 -- Dispute Resolution Among Parties

1. Disputes among Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Treaty shall be resolved through negotiation, mediation, or, if necessary, binding arbitration before a panel appointed by the Council.

2. In interpreting this Treaty, the Council and any arbitral panel shall apply the general rule of interpretation reflected in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, reading the Treaty's terms in their context, in light of its object and purpose, and with due regard to its preamble.

3. No Party shall resort to coercion, retaliation, or public vilification as a means of resolving disputes with other Parties.

## Interpretive Appendix: Analytical Foundations and Distinctions

### I. Theoretical Grounding

This Treaty draws upon three convergent traditions of political and legal thought:

**Social Contract Theory.** From Locke's *Second Treatise on Government* through Rawls's *A Theory of Justice*, the Western liberal tradition has maintained that legitimate political authority arises from the rational consent of the governed and is conditional upon the government's fulfillment of its correlative obligations. This Treaty operationalizes that principle by defining what constitutes a material breach of the compact and by establishing institutional mechanisms for collective response.

**International Human Rights Law.** The post-1945 international legal order recognizes that states bear obligations to their citizens under treaty and customary law, and that the international community has a legitimate interest in the fulfillment of those obligations. The mechanisms established by this Treaty are modeled on and complementary to existing international mechanisms, including the Universal Periodic Review, treaty body monitoring, and the complaints procedures established under various human rights instruments.

**Democratic Accountability Theory.** The Treaty draws on the scholarly literature on democratic backsliding, institutional capture, and authoritarian resilience to define the categories of breach in Article 7. The graduated response framework in Article 8 reflects the empirical finding that democratic erosion is typically incremental, and that effective accountability mechanisms must be capable of responding early and proportionately.

### II. Critical Distinction: Collective Accountability vs. Individual Exemption

The Treaty's most important structural feature is its categorical rejection of the premise that any individual may, by personal declaration, exempt themselves from the legal order. This distinguishes it from sovereign citizen ideology along multiple dimensions:

**Institutional process, not personal declaration.** Sovereign citizen ideology asserts that individuals can, by reciting particular phrases or filing particular documents, opt out of the legal system. This Treaty establishes that breach determinations are made through an institutional process with evidentiary standards, burden of proof, right of response, and multiple levels of review.

**Collective action, not individual exemption.** The Treaty's mechanisms operate collectively. No individual Party gains a personal legal exemption from any obligation. Instead, the Parties collectively determine whether a governmental authority has breached its compact, and collectively undertake response measures.

**Working within the legal order, not rejecting it.** The Treaty's remedies operate primarily through legal channels: constitutional litigation, international advocacy, treaty body complaints, and coordinated public action. It explicitly prohibits the use of force and explicitly requires compliance with domestic law in all jurisdictions where Parties operate.

**Acknowledging democratic imperfection, not demanding utopia.** The Treaty includes explicit provisions (Articles 3(4) and 7(4)) recognizing that democratic governance is imperfect, that policy disagreement is not breach, and that electoral loss is not oppression. This stands in stark contrast to sovereign citizen movements, which typically reject the legitimacy of governmental authority categorically.

### III. On Normative Ratification and the Vienna Convention Framework

The consent framework established in Article 15 adapts the Vienna Convention's architecture of consent to be bound (Articles 11-17 VCLT) to the non-state context of this Treaty. The adaptation is grounded in two observations:

First, the Vienna Convention itself recognizes, in Article 11, that consent to be bound may be expressed "by any other means if so agreed." While this provision contemplates state practice, it reflects a broader principle: that the form of consent is subordinate to the fact of consent. The IMAT extends this principle to natural persons, providing that consent may be established not only by formal act but also by a sustained pattern of normatively significant conduct within a shared community of practice.

Second, the concept of normative ratification by practice draws on the well-established international law concept of acquiescence--the principle that a state (or, by analogy, a person) may become bound by a norm through consistent conduct that manifests acceptance. The International Court of Justice has recognized acquiescence as a basis for legal obligation in numerous cases, including the *Temple of Preah Vihear* (1962) and *Fisheries Jurisdiction* (1974) cases. The IMAT adapts this principle to the inter-individual context, with the critical safeguard that no person may be deemed to have consented against their express disavowal (Article 15(8)(d)).

The *inter se* character of this consent framework (Article 15(4)) is drawn from the Vienna Convention's treatment of *inter se* modification of multilateral treaties (Article 41 VCLT). It ensures that the Treaty's obligations operate only among those who have consented, and that the framework does not purport to bind, constrain, or impose upon any non-consenting party--whether individual, entity, or state.

The non-imposition principle articulated in Article 18 expressly mirrors the Vienna Convention's *pacta tertiis* rule (Article 34 VCLT), reinforcing that this Treaty creates no obligations for third parties and claims no authority beyond the voluntary association of its members.

### IV. Relationship to Existing Frameworks

The Treaty is designed to complement, not compete with, existing accountability mechanisms. Its niche is the space between purely domestic remedies (which may be captured or rendered ineffective by the very conduct at issue) and fully international mechanisms (which are often slow, state-centered, and dependent on political will). By organizing individuals into a structured collective with institutional processes, the Treaty provides an intermediate mechanism for accountability that can act with greater agility than international bodies while maintaining the legitimacy that comes from procedural rigor and evidentiary discipline.

This positioning also addresses a structural gap in the international order: the fact that existing human rights mechanisms are overwhelmingly state-to-state or state-to-individual, with limited provision for organized citizen-to-state accountability. The IMAT framework fills this gap by providing citizens with an institutional vehicle for collective action that is more structured and accountable than ad hoc protest movements, while remaining more agile and responsive than formal international treaty bodies.

The normative ratification mechanism further addresses a practical challenge: that formal ratification processes, designed for states with established diplomatic infrastructure, are poorly adapted to the decentralized, networked character of contemporary civic association. By recognizing conduct-based consent alongside formal endorsement, the Treaty accommodates the reality that normative communities increasingly form, cohere, and operate through shared practice in digital and distributed contexts--while maintaining the procedural safeguards necessary to prevent abuse of the mechanism.
