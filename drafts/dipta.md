CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSE, DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE,

AND PROSPECTIVE TRANSPARENCY ACT

(CD-DIPTA)

A thought experiment for validating and making accountable domestic intelligence operations for constitutional defense. 

An Act

To establish legislative authority over domestic constitutional defense intelligence operations through a bipartisan joint commission with structural incentives for neutral arbitration, to authorize such operations subject to mandatory prospective transparency, and to ensure accountability across administrations through mutual vulnerability mechanisms, as a complement to existing intelligence oversight and law enforcement frameworks.

TITLE I—FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND DEFINITIONS

SECTION 101. FINDINGS

Congress finds the following:

The Constitution of the United States constitutes the supreme political and legal order of the Republic, and its preservation against foreign subversion is a national security function that transcends partisan interest.

Foreign intelligence threats increasingly manifest through domestic intermediaries, compromised officials, and institutional manipulation, rendering traditional foreign/domestic distinctions operationally inadequate in specific circumstances.

Executive branch oversight of domestic intelligence activity is structurally inadequate because the executive may itself become a vector for foreign compromise, may abuse such authority for partisan advantage, or may fail to act when constitutional defense requires action.

Traditional congressional oversight has proven insufficient due to majority-party deference to same-party presidents, minority-party exclusion from meaningful authority, and institutional incentives that prioritize partisan advantage over constitutional protection.

In a system of alternating party control, both major parties have long-term institutional interests in constraining domestic intelligence abuse, because today's governing majority becomes tomorrow's potential target.

Effective oversight of domestic intelligence requires structural mechanisms that make future vulnerability salient at the moment of authorization, creating bipartisan incentives for restraint that operate regardless of which party holds power.

Democratic legitimacy for extraordinary intelligence authority may be preserved where authorization requires bipartisan concurrence, secrecy is temporary, disclosure is guaranteed, and decision-makers know their actions will be publicly judged within their political lifetimes.

SECTION 102. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

(a) Purpose.—This Act establishes a framework for authorizing domestic intelligence operations to defend the constitutional order against foreign subversion in circumstances where existing mechanisms prove inadequate. It creates bipartisan legislative oversight with structural safeguards against partisan abuse, and ensures accountability through mandatory prospective transparency.

(b) Relationship to Existing Authorities.—This Act is intended as a complement to, not a replacement for, existing intelligence and law enforcement frameworks, including:

Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.—This Act does not modify FISA authorities. Where FISA procedures are adequate to address a threat, they shall be used. This Act applies only where the Commission finds that FISA and related authorities are insufficient to address a systemic constitutional threat.

Criminal Process.—This Act does not displace ordinary criminal investigation and prosecution. Where criminal authorities are adequate, they shall be used. This Act applies only where the Commission finds that criminal process alone cannot timely address a threat to constitutional governance.

Covert Action Authorities.—This Act does not modify Title 50 covert action authorities for foreign operations. This Act governs only domestic operations and applies only where existing covert action frameworks do not adequately address domestic manifestations of foreign threats.

(c) Narrow Application.—This Act is intended for rare, systemic constitutional threats, not routine counterintelligence. The Commission shall not authorize operations under this Act where existing authorities are adequate, and shall document in each authorization why existing frameworks are insufficient.

SECTION 103. DEFINITIONS

In this Act:

Commission.—The term "Commission" means the Joint Commission on Constitutional Defense Intelligence established under Section 201.

Constitutional Defense Operation.—The term "constitutional defense operation" means any intelligence or counterintelligence activity conducted within the United States for the purpose of identifying, monitoring, disrupting, or neutralizing foreign intelligence operations directed against the constitutional order of the United States.

Constitutional Order.—The term "constitutional order" means:

(A) the integrity of federal elections and the peaceful transfer of power;

(B) the separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches;

(C) the independence of the federal judiciary;

(D) the capacity of Congress to exercise its constitutional functions free from foreign coercion;

(E) fundamental civil rights and liberties secured by the Constitution; and

(F) the sovereignty of the United States in matters of national governance.

The term does not include ordinary domestic political advocacy, even where such advocacy aligns with positions favored by foreign governments, unless such advocacy is conducted at the direction of, or with material support from, a foreign intelligence service.

Foreign Power.—The term "foreign power" has the meaning given that term in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801).

Position of Public Trust.—The term "position of public trust" means any elected federal office, any position requiring Senate confirmation, any federal judicial office, any general or flag officer position in the Armed Forces, any Senior Executive Service position, and any other position designated by the Commission as bearing significant responsibility for national security or constitutional governance.

Senior Official.—The term "senior official" means the President, Vice President, any member of Congress, any Article III judge, any Cabinet member, or any general or flag officer.

United States Person.—The term "United States person" has the meaning given that term in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801).

United States Person Targeting.—The term "United States person targeting" means any constitutional defense operation in which a United States person is a primary subject of intelligence collection, surveillance, infiltration, disruption, or exposure activities.

SECTION 104. GOVERNING PRINCIPLES

(a) Legislative Primacy.—Authority to authorize domestic constitutional defense intelligence operations shall be vested in a joint legislative commission operating under supermajority and cross-party requirements. The executive branch shall implement operations authorized by the Commission but may not conduct such operations without Commission authorization.

(b) Mutual Vulnerability as Constraint.—The structures established by this Act are designed to ensure that no party can authorize domestic intelligence operations that it would not accept being conducted against its own members when out of power. Authorization decisions shall be made with the understanding that precedents set today bind future administrations of either party.

(c) Prospective Transparency.—No operation may proceed unless all authorizing officials, including Commission members, accept mandatory, irreversible public disclosure within fixed timelines. Secrecy is permitted only on credit, not indefinitely.

(d) Minority Protection.—The structures established by this Act shall ensure that minority party members possess substantive authority to block, modify, or terminate operations, recognizing that the minority party has the greatest interest in preventing abuse and the least capacity for abuse.

TITLE II—JOINT COMMISSION ON CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE

SECTION 201. ESTABLISHMENT

(a) Commission Established.—There is established a Joint Commission on Constitutional Defense Intelligence.

(b) Composition.—The Commission shall consist of eight members of Congress, as follows:

Two Senators appointed by the Minority Leader of the Senate;

Two Representatives appointed by the Speaker of the House; and

Two Representatives appointed by the Minority Leader of the House.

(c) Partisan Balance.—The Commission shall at all times consist of four members affiliated with the party holding the presidency and four members affiliated with the party not holding the presidency. Upon any change in the party holding the presidency, Commission membership shall be reconstituted accordingly within 30 days.

(d) Terms.—Members shall serve four-year terms, staggered so that two members from each chamber (one from each party) are appointed every two years. Members may be reappointed.

(e) Qualifications.—Members shall have served in Congress for at least one full term and shall hold appropriate security clearances. Members shall not simultaneously serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence or the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

SECTION 202. LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE

(a) Co-Chairs.—The Commission shall be led by two Co-Chairs: one from the party holding the presidency (the "Majority Co-Chair") and one from the party not holding the presidency (the "Minority Co-Chair"). Both Co-Chairs must concur for any authorization to proceed.

(b) Selection.—Each party's Commission members shall select their Co-Chair from among themselves.

(c) Equal Authority.—Both Co-Chairs shall have equal authority over Commission proceedings, access to information, and direction of staff. Neither Co-Chair may act unilaterally on any matter of substance.

SECTION 203. VOTING REQUIREMENTS

(a) Supermajority Requirement.—Authorization of any constitutional defense operation requires the affirmative vote of at least six of eight Commission members.

(b) Cross-Party Requirement.—No authorization may proceed unless at least two members of each party vote in favor. An authorization supported only by members of the president's party, regardless of total votes, is invalid.

(c) United States Person Targeting.—Authorization to target any United States person requires the affirmative vote of at least seven of eight Commission members, including at least three members of the party not holding the presidency.

(d) Senior Official Targeting.—Authorization to target a senior official requires either:

unanimous consent of all eight Commission members; or

the affirmative vote of at least seven Commission members, including at least three members of the party not holding the presidency, together with: (A) a written emergency certification by the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community that the threat is imminent and that delay would materially endanger the constitutional order; and (B) automatic accelerated Tier 3 disclosure within 18 months rather than the standard timeline; and (C) mandatory notification to the full membership of both chambers of Congress (in classified session if necessary) within 72 hours.

(e) Minority Halt Authority.—Any three Commission members, acting jointly, may immediately suspend any ongoing operation pending full Commission review. The operation may not resume unless reauthorized under the requirements of this section.

SECTION 204. COMMISSION STAFF

(a) Staff Director.—The Commission shall appoint a Staff Director by vote of at least six members. The Staff Director shall serve a six-year term and may be removed only by vote of at least six members.

(b) Professional Staff.—The Commission shall employ professional staff with expertise in intelligence, law, and constitutional matters. Staff shall be appointed by the Staff Director and shall serve the Commission as an institution, not individual members.

(c) Staff Independence.—Commission staff shall have protected tenure and may not be removed except for cause. Staff shall not be detailed from any executive branch agency. Former intelligence community employees may not serve on Commission staff until five years after separation from intelligence service.

(d) Analytical Capacity.—The Commission staff shall include an analytical division capable of independently assessing intelligence predicates, reviewing operational proposals, and monitoring ongoing operations. The analytical division shall have access to all intelligence available to the executive branch relevant to constitutional defense matters.

(e) Nonpartisan Duty.—All staff shall take an oath to serve the Commission without regard to partisan affiliation and to provide objective analysis to all members equally. Staff who violate this duty are subject to immediate termination and permanent disqualification from federal employment.

SECTION 205. COMMISSION PROCEDURES

(a) Meetings.—The Commission shall meet at least monthly and additionally upon call of either Co-Chair or any three members.

(b) Quorum.—Six members, including at least two from each party, shall constitute a quorum.

(c) Information Access.—All Commission members shall have equal access to all classified information relevant to Commission business. No member may be excluded from any briefing or denied access to any document. No assertion of executive privilege shall be sustained with respect to information necessary to evaluate petitions under this Act, except where disclosure would create an imminent and specific risk to the safety of ongoing covert human sources; in such cases, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community and Commission Counsel shall receive full access and shall provide the Commission with a summary assessment.

(d) Records.—The Commission shall maintain complete records of all proceedings, deliberations, and votes. These records are subject to the transparency provisions of Title IV.

(e) Member Accountability.—Each member's vote on every authorization shall be recorded and shall be subject to public disclosure under the timelines of Title IV. Members may not abstain from votes on authorization.

TITLE III—AUTHORIZATION OF OPERATIONS

SECTION 301. PETITION FOR AUTHORIZATION

(a) Executive Petition.—The President, Attorney General, or Director of National Intelligence may petition the Commission for authorization to conduct constitutional defense operations.

(b) Commission Initiative.—The Commission may, on its own initiative by vote of at least five members including at least two from each party, direct the executive branch to prepare an operational proposal addressing a constitutional defense threat identified by Commission staff.

(c) Member Petition.—Any three Commission members may petition for consideration of a constitutional defense threat, requiring the Commission to convene and the executive branch to provide relevant intelligence within 72 hours.

(d) Contents of Petition.—Any petition shall include:

identification of the foreign intelligence threat to the constitutional order, with reference to the specific elements of constitutional order defined in Section 103;

the intelligence basis for the assessment;

explanation of why existing legal mechanisms, including FISA, criminal process, and existing covert action authorities, are insufficient;

the specific operations proposed;

identification of any United States persons proposed for targeting; and

certification that petitioners accept the transparency obligations of Title IV.

SECTION 302. ADVERSARIAL REVIEW

(a) Mandatory Adversarial Process.—No authorization may be granted without formal adversarial proceedings in which designated counsel argues against authorization.

(b) Commission Counsel.—The Commission shall employ permanent counsel whose duty is to challenge the necessity, proportionality, and legality of proposed operations. Commission Counsel shall have access to all relevant intelligence and shall prepare written opposition to every petition.

(c) Target Representation.—For any petition involving United States person targeting, Commission Counsel shall specifically represent the interests of the proposed target, arguing as if retained by that person.

(d) Written Record.—Both the petition and the adversarial response shall be reduced to writing and preserved as part of the Commission record, subject to disclosure under Title IV.

SECTION 303. AUTHORIZATION STANDARD

(a) Required Findings.—The Commission may authorize constitutional defense operations upon finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that:

a foreign power or coordinated foreign intelligence effort is engaged in sustained operations against the constitutional order, as defined in Section 103;

existing domestic legal mechanisms, including FISA, criminal process, and existing covert action authorities, are insufficient to address the threat;

the proposed operations are necessary and proportionate to the threat; and

less intrusive means would be inadequate.

(b) Precedent Consideration.—Before authorizing any operation, the Commission shall expressly consider whether the authorization would create precedent that members would accept if applied by a future administration of the opposing party against members of their own party. This consideration shall be recorded in the Commission's findings.

(c) United States Person Targeting.—Authorization to target a United States person requires probable cause to believe the person is acting as an agent, asset, or coerced intermediary of a foreign power, or probable cause to believe the person occupies a position of public trust and is compromised or subject to foreign leverage.

SECTION 304. SCOPE OF AUTHORIZED OPERATIONS

(a) Authorized Activities.—When authorized by the Commission, designated intelligence elements may conduct within the United States intelligence and counterintelligence activities otherwise lawful when conducted abroad, including:

human intelligence operations;

signals intelligence collection;

covert action short of kinetic force;

counterintelligence disruption;

influence neutralization and exposure operations, subject to subsection (d); and

penetration of hostile networks.

(b) Prohibitions.—This Act does not authorize summary detention, extrajudicial killing, suspension of habeas corpus, military occupation of civilian institutions, any kinetic military operation, or any activity exceeding the Commission's authorization.

(c) Law Enforcement Reservation.—Arrest and prosecution remain the exclusive responsibility of civilian law enforcement operating under ordinary constitutional protections.

(d) Safeguards for Influence Neutralization and Exposure Operations.—Influence neutralization and exposure operations authorized under this section:

may not involve the fabrication or manipulation of evidence;

may not involve intentionally misleading the public about verifiable facts;

may not involve impersonation of journalists or news organizations;

shall be limited to the exposure of true information regarding foreign intelligence activities and the correction of foreign-originated disinformation; and

shall be documented in sufficient detail to permit post-hoc assessment of compliance with these requirements.

SECTION 305. DURATION AND RENEWAL

(a) Initial Duration.—No authorization may exceed 90 days.

(b) Renewal.—Renewal requires new petition, fresh adversarial proceedings, and satisfaction of all voting requirements. There is no presumption in favor of renewal.

(c) Termination.—Any authorization may be terminated at any time by vote of at least four Commission members or by exercise of the minority halt authority under Section 203(e).

TITLE IV—TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

SECTION 401. TRANSPARENCY CONSENT REQUIREMENT

(a) Condition Precedent.—No authorization may be granted unless each Commission member voting in favor, the petitioner, and the head of each designated intelligence element certify acceptance of the transparency obligations of this Title.

(b) Member Certification.—Each Commission member voting for authorization shall sign a Transparency Consent Finding certifying that:

their vote will be subject to public disclosure;

they accept personal political accountability for the authorization;

they have considered whether they would accept this precedent if applied against their own party; and

they acknowledge that the authorization will be judged by the public within their political lifetimes.

(c) Willingness Test.—If any certifying official determines that disclosure within the statutory timeframe would be politically, reputationally, or legally unacceptable, such determination shall create a rebuttable presumption against authorization. The presumption may be overcome only by a written, unanimous explanation by all members of the party not holding the presidency stating why the operation should nonetheless proceed and why the concerns are outweighed by constitutional necessity. Such explanation shall be part of the record subject to disclosure.

SECTION 402. MANDATORY DECLASSIFICATION TIMELINE

(a) Classification Ceiling.—No record generated under this Act may be classified beyond CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSE RESTRICTED, which is legally incompatible with indefinite classification.

(b) Timeline.—Declassification shall occur as follows, without extension or exemption:

Tier 1 — Aggregate Statistics (12 months).—Total operations, total targets, categories of targeting authority, institutional affiliations of targets.

Tier 2 — Deliberative Records (3 years).—Petitions, adversarial responses, Commission deliberations, member votes, legal memoranda, transparency certifications, dissents.

Tier 3 — Full Operational Records (7 years).—Target identities, intelligence collected, operations conducted, internal communications, names of all authorizing officials.

Tier 4 — Sources and Methods (15 years).—Human source identities (subject to witness protection), technical specifications, foreign liaison contributions.

(c) Accelerated Disclosure for Senior Officials.—Operations targeting senior officials are subject to Tier 3 disclosure within three years, or within 18 months if authorized under the emergency procedures of Section 203(d)(2).

(d) No Extension Authority.—No official of any branch may delay, extend, or exempt any record from this schedule.

SECTION 403. INDEPENDENT RECORDS CUSTODIAN

(a) Establishment.—There is established within the legislative branch the Office of the Constitutional Defense Records Custodian.

(b) Appointment.—The Custodian shall be appointed by the Commission by vote of at least six members to serve a single fifteen-year term, removable only for cause by vote of at least six members.

(c) Transmission.—All records generated under this Act, by both the Commission and the executive branch, shall be transmitted to the Custodian within 48 hours of creation.

(d) Functions.—The Custodian shall maintain independent custody; verify completeness; trigger automatic declassification; notify targets upon disclosure; and refer discrepancies to the Commission and Department of Justice.

(e) Independence.—The Custodian shall maintain physically segregated archives with no connectivity to executive branch systems.

SECTION 404. TARGET NOTIFICATION AND REMEDY

(a) Notification.—Upon Tier 3 declassification, the Custodian shall notify all living United States persons who were targeted, including the period of targeting, categories of activity, and the legal basis relied upon.

(b) Standing.—Any targeted person shall have statutory standing to seek judicial review.

(c) Civil Remedy.—Targeted persons may bring civil actions against the United States and against individual officials, including Commission members, for operations conducted without adequate predicate or exceeding authorization. In any such action:

the court shall conduct in camera review of all relevant classified materials;

the court shall appoint a special master with appropriate clearances to assist in evaluating classified evidence;

plaintiff's counsel shall be provided security clearances and access to classified materials under appropriate protective orders;

no claim for liability or injunctive relief may be dismissed solely on the basis of the state secrets privilege where the Custodian's records independently establish that a violation occurred.

(d) Member Liability.—Commission members are subject to personal civil liability for authorizations made in bad faith, without adequate basis, or for partisan rather than constitutional defense purposes. Authorizations under this Act are executive-type decisions for purposes of determining the scope of legislative immunity, and no provision of this Act shall be construed to expand legislative immunity to actions not otherwise legislative in nature.

SECTION 405. DISSENT REGISTRY

(a) Right to Dissent.—Any Commission member, staff member, or executive branch official may register a formal dissent with the Custodian.

(b) Disclosure.—Dissents shall be disclosed at Tier 2 with attribution.

(c) Protection.—No adverse action may be taken against any person for registering a dissent.

SECTION 406. FAILURE MODES AND SANCTIONS

(a) Automatic Suspension.—Violation of any transparency obligation shall result in immediate automatic suspension of all authorizations associated with the defective record chain. Within 72 hours of suspension, the Commission shall vote on whether:

the violation has been cured and the suspended operations may resume;

other operations not associated with the defective record chain may continue; and

the matter should be referred for criminal investigation.

(b) Retroactive Voiding.—Upon Commission finding that a transparency violation was willful or involved destruction of records, all authorizations associated with the violation shall be voided ab initio, exposing all authorizing officials to personal liability.

(c) Criminal Penalties.—Destruction, concealment, or alteration of records, or willful action to delay declassification, is punishable by not less than five years imprisonment.

(d) Rule of Construction.—Ambiguities shall be construed against the government and in favor of disclosure, standing, and remedy.

TITLE V—OVERSIGHT, SAFEGUARDS, AND GENERAL PROVISIONS

SECTION 501. INSPECTOR GENERAL OVERSIGHT

(a) Continuous Review.—The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community shall conduct continuous review of all operations under this Act and report monthly to the Commission.

(b) Direct Reporting.—The Inspector General may report concerns directly to any Commission member without executive branch intermediation.

(c) Protection.—The Inspector General may not be removed during the pendency of any authorized operation except by vote of six Commission members.

SECTION 502. JUDICIAL REVIEW

(a) Availability.—Any United States person who believes they have been targeted under this Act may petition the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for review upon Tier 3 disclosure.

(b) Standard of Review.—The Court shall review whether the Commission's authorization was supported by substantial evidence and whether the operation was conducted within the scope of authorization.

(c) Remedy.—The Court may award damages, enjoin ongoing operations, and refer matters for criminal prosecution.

SECTION 503. ANTI-ENTRENCHMENT PROVISIONS

(a) Prohibition on Domestic Political Operations.—No authorization may be granted for operations whose primary purpose is to advantage or disadvantage any political party, candidate, or domestic political organization. Any member who votes for such an authorization is personally liable.

(b) Prohibition on Self-Protection.—No authorization may be granted for operations designed to protect incumbent officeholders from legitimate political accountability, investigation, or electoral challenge.

(c) Prohibition on Press Targeting.—No authorization may be granted for operations targeting journalists, news organizations, or sources engaged in journalism, except upon specific finding that the target is acting as a knowing agent of a foreign intelligence service in a manner unrelated to journalistic activity.

(d) Sunset.—The authority granted by this Act shall expire ten years after enactment unless reauthorized by Congress. Reauthorization shall require assessment of how the authority has been used, whether the mutual vulnerability mechanisms have functioned as intended, and whether modifications are necessary.

SECTION 504. SEVERABILITY

If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this Act and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected.

SECTION 505. THEORY OF LEGITIMACY

Congress expressly finds that the legitimacy of authority under this Act derives from:

bipartisan authorization requiring cross-party concurrence, ensuring no single party can weaponize domestic intelligence;

minority protection through substantive blocking authority, recognizing that the out-party has the greatest interest in preventing abuse;

mutual vulnerability that makes future consequences salient, because today's majority is tomorrow's potential target;

personal accountability through mandatory transparency, preventing officials from hiding behind institutional anonymity; and

the certainty of disclosure, which constrains behavior even when present-tense checks fail.

This Act harnesses partisan self-interest in service of constitutional protection, ensuring that the instincts which might otherwise drive abuse instead constrain it.
