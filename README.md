# Remedial Legitimacy Framework

A collection of constitutional counter-instruments: documents that use the precise language and structural conventions of legal authority to articulate theoretical positions about the gap between *law-as-written* and *law-as-practiced*.

## Overview

The Remedial Legitimacy Framework develops speculative legal instruments that:

- **Bridge Gaps**: Address the space between nominal legal status and operational reality
- **Distribute Accountability**: Create mesh networks of responsibility and authority
- **Derive Conscience-Based Authority**: Generate force from documentation and moral logic rather than institutional recognition alone
- **Activate Upon Failure**: Lie dormant until triggered by institutional non-performance
- **Enable Aggregation**: Allow individual claims to consolidate into collective authority

## Instruments

### [Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody and Free Association Lease](./instruments/instrument_delegated_rights_custody.md)

Establishes a mechanism for temporary delegation of rights-defense functions to willing third parties during periods of institutional non-performance. Key innovation: inverts traditional standing doctrine so that rights violations activate delegated authority rather than rights possession alone.

### [Compact of Mutual Witness](./instruments/compact_of_mutual_witness.md)

Charter for distributed accountability and pattern documentation. Creates reciprocal obligations for evidence preservation, testimonial support, and pattern correlation across networks of any size. Key innovations: independent invocation authority, reputational accountability, and distributed exclusion.

### [Compact of Mutual Intervention](./instruments/compact_mutual_intervention.md)

Charter for outside accountability when sovereignty degrades. Applies collective defense logic to institutional failures: systematic sovereignty degradation affecting any citizens is a threat to all citizens' sovereignty. Establishes mutual assistance obligations for monitoring, documentation, advocacy, and pressure when domestic accountability mechanisms fail.

### [Instrument of Conditional Legitimacy](./instruments/instrument_conditional_legitimacy.md)

Documentary instrument for articulating that compliance is conditional cooperation contingent on institutional performance, not unconditional consent. Establishes a framework for conditioning cooperation on institutional good faith when institutions responsible for protecting constitutional rights instead become agents of their degradation.
