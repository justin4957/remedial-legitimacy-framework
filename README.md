# Remedial Legitimacy Framework

A collection of constitutional counter-instruments: documents that use the precise language and structural conventions of legal authority to articulate theoretical positions about the gap between *law-as-written* and *law-as-practiced*.

## Overview

The Remedial Legitimacy Framework develops speculative legal instruments that:

- **Bridge Gaps**: Address the space between nominal legal status and operational reality
- **Distribute Accountability**: Create mesh networks of responsibility and authority
- **Derive Conscience-Based Authority**: Generate force from documentation and moral logic rather than institutional recognition alone
- **Activate Upon Failure**: Lie dormant until triggered by institutional non-performance
- **Enable Aggregation**: Allow individual claims to consolidate into collective authority
- **Provide Meta-Frameworks**: Establish principles for creating and governing other instruments

## Project Status

This is a theoretical and documentary project exploring how legal instruments might acknowledge and respond to the gap between constitutional promises and operational reality.

**Current Collection**: 3 ratified instruments, 22 proposed instruments across 6 categories

### Featured Instruments

**[Instrument of Delegated Rights Custody and Free Association Lease](./instruments/instrument_delegated_rights_custody.md)** (Category A)

The foundational document of the framework. Establishes a mechanism for temporary delegation of rights-defense functions to willing third parties during periods of institutional non-performance. Key innovation: inverts traditional standing doctrine so that rights violations activate delegated authority rather than rights possession alone.

**[Compact of Mutual Witness](./instruments/compact_of_mutual_witness.md)** (Category B)

Charter for distributed accountability and pattern documentation. Creates reciprocal obligations for evidence preservation, testimonial support, and pattern correlation across networks of any size. Key innovations: independent invocation authority (action without consensus), reputational accountability (known documentation creates moral custody), and distributed exclusion (scales infinitely without formal governance).

**[Compact of Mutual Intervention](./instruments/compact_mutual_intervention.md)** (Category B)

Charter for outside accountability when sovereignty degrades. Extends NATO Article 5 collective defense logic to institutional failures: systematic sovereignty degradation affecting any citizens is a threat to all citizens' sovereignty. Establishes mutual assistance obligations for monitoring, documentation, advocacy, and pressure when domestic accountability mechanisms fail. Key innovations: collective defense principle for sovereignty, distributed invocation authority, threshold documentation integration, exhaustion of remedies requirement, and recognition of actions independent of formal execution.

## Contributing

Proposals for new instruments should be submitted as GitHub issues using the instrument proposal template. Each proposal should identify:

1. The gap or failure mode being addressed
2. The mechanism by which the instrument operates
3. The category of instrument
4. Ethical constraints and limitations
