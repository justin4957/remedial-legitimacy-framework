# Remedial Legitimacy Framework

A collection of constitutional counter-instruments: documents that use the precise language and structural conventions of legal authority to articulate theoretical positions about the gap between *law-as-written* and *law-as-practiced*.

## Overview

The Remedial Legitimacy Framework develops speculative legal instruments that:

- **Bridge Gaps**: Address the space between nominal legal status and operational reality
- **Distribute Accountability**: Create mesh networks of responsibility and authority
- **Derive Conscience-Based Authority**: Generate force from documentation and moral logic rather than institutional recognition alone
- **Activate Upon Failure**: Lie dormant until triggered by institutional non-performance
- **Enable Aggregation**: Allow individual claims to consolidate into collective authority
- **Provide Meta-Frameworks**: Establish principles for creating and governing other instruments

## Project Status

This is a theoretical and documentary project exploring how legal instruments might acknowledge and respond to the gap between constitutional promises and operational reality.

## Instrument Categories

### A. Gap-Bridging Instruments
Documents addressing the space between nominal status and operational reality

### B. Distributed Accountability Instruments
Documents creating mesh networks of responsibility and authority

### C. Conscience-Based Authority Instruments
Documents deriving force from documentation and moral logic

### D. Activation-Upon-Failure Instruments
Documents that lie dormant until triggered by institutional non-performance

### E. Aggregation Instruments
Documents enabling individual claims to consolidate into collective authority

### F. Meta-Instruments
Documents about the creation and governance of other instruments

## Contributing

Proposals for new instruments should be submitted as GitHub issues using the instrument proposal template. Each proposal should identify:

1. The gap or failure mode being addressed
2. The mechanism by which the instrument operates
3. The category of instrument
4. Ethical constraints and limitations
