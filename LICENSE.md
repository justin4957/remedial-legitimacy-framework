## Share-Alike

Derivative works must be licensed under this license (RLPL v1.0 or later) or a compatible copyleft license that preserves attribution and share-alike provisions.

Derivative works must make source materials (editable text, not just PDF) available under the same terms.

Derivative works that substantially alter the meaning or operation of an instrument must clearly indicate they are modified versions.

---

## Reserved Rights

The Original Author reserves exclusive rights to:

- Authorize official hard copy publications
- Designate canonical or authoritative versions
- Create or authorize limited edition, numbered, or signed physical copies
- License hard copy distribution for commercial use

**Commercial use requires prior written permission** from the Original Author.

This license does not grant rights to use the Original Author's name, trademarks, or "Remedial Legitimacy Framework" in ways suggesting official status or endorsement.

---

## Disclaimers

**No Warranty** — The Original Work is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, legal efficacy, or non-infringement.

**No Legal Advice** — Nothing in the Original Work constitutes legal advice. The instruments are theoretical and documentary in nature. Consult qualified legal counsel for any legal purposes.

**No Liability** — The Original Author is not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from use of the Original Work.

**No Guarantee of Recognition** — The Original Author makes no representation that any instrument will be recognized or given effect by any institution, court, or authority.

---

## Termination

Rights terminate automatically upon:

- Uncured violation of attribution requirements (30 days after notice)
- Violation of share-alike provisions
- Misrepresentation of a derivative work as the Original Work
- Use that creates new harms or violates ethical principles articulated in the instruments

Termination does not affect rights of third parties who received compliant copies before termination. Rights may be reinstated upon cure and written confirmation from the Original Author.

---

## General

**Severability** — If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder continues in effect.

**No Waiver** — Failure to enforce any provision does not waive that right.

**Future Versions** — The Original Author may publish revised versions. You may follow the version under which you received the work or any later version.

**Disputes** — This license should be interpreted according to its plain meaning. Disputes should be guided by the principles in the instruments themselves: good faith engagement, exhaustion of remedies, proportionality, and documentation.

## Commentary

*This section is explanatory and does not create obligations.*

A license for documents about legitimacy raises questions about its own legitimacy. All legal instruments operate through similar leaps of faith—that properly formatted text creates binding effect. Software licenses and legal instruments both concern the replication and governance of text that aspires to shape reality.

The hard copy reservation maintains a canonical authoritative version, enables sustainable support through limited physical editions, and preserves distinction between the freely-available framework and its formal instantiations.

No signature required. Use constitutes acceptance.

*Though if you feel compelled to sign something, we understand.*
