# Remedial Legitimacy Public License (RLPL) v1.0

## Preamble

WHEREAS software licenses attempt to govern the replication and modification of code;

WHEREAS legal instruments attempt to govern the conduct of persons and institutions;

WHEREAS both operate through the peculiar fiction that text, properly formatted, creates binding obligation;

WHEREAS this collection of instruments addresses the gap between authority-as-claimed and legitimacy-as-earned;

NOW THEREFORE, in recognition that licensing a framework about legitimacy creates a delightful recursion, this License establishes terms for use, modification, and distribution of the Remedial Legitimacy Framework and its constituent instruments.

**5.4 Institutional Filing Notice.** Parties who engage in Institutional Deployment of any instrument are encouraged (but not required) to notify the Original Author for documentation purposes. Such notification does not create any obligation on the part of the Original Author.

## Article VI. Warranty Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

**6.1 As-Is Provision.** THE ORIGINAL WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, LEGAL EFFICACY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

**6.2 No Legal Advice.** Nothing in the Original Work constitutes legal advice. The instruments are theoretical and documentary in nature. Users who wish to employ any instrument for legal purposes should consult qualified legal counsel in their jurisdiction.

**6.3 Limitation of Liability.** IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM USE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE.

**6.4 Institutional Performance Disclaimer.** The Original Author makes no representation that any instrument will be recognized, honored, or given effect by any institution, court, or authority. *The irony of this disclaimer appearing in a framework about institutional non-performance is noted but not resolved.*

---

## Article VII. Termination

**7.1 Automatic Termination.** Rights granted under this License terminate automatically upon:

   (a) Violation of attribution requirements that remains uncured for 30 days after notice;

   (b) Violation of copyleft provisions;

   (c) Misrepresentation of a Derivative Work as the Original Work;

   (d) Use of the Original Work in ways that create new harms or violate the ethical principles articulated within the instruments themselves.

**7.2 Survival.** Termination does not affect rights of third parties who received copies in compliance with this License prior to termination.

**7.3 Reinstatement.** Rights may be reinstated upon cure of the violation and written confirmation from the Original Author.

---

## Article VIII. Miscellaneous

**8.1 Severability.** If any provision of this License is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions continue in effect.

**8.2 No Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision does not constitute waiver of rights.

**8.3 Entire Agreement.** This License constitutes the entire agreement between parties regarding use of the Original Work, superseding prior agreements.

**8.4 Governing Law.** This License shall be interpreted according to its plain meaning. In the event of dispute, the parties agree that the principles articulated in the instruments themselves—good faith engagement, exhaustion of remedies, proportionality, and documentation—should guide resolution.

**8.5 Future Versions.** The Original Author may publish revised versions of this License. Users may choose to follow the terms of the version under which they received the work or any later version.

## Article IX. Commentary

*This section is explanatory and does not create binding obligations.*

**9.1 On Recursive Legitimacy.** A license governing documents about legitimacy necessarily raises questions about its own legitimacy. We acknowledge this recursion and proceed anyway, noting that all legal instruments operate through similar acts of faith.

**9.2 On Software Licensing Conventions.** This License borrows structural conventions from open-source software licensing (copyleft, attribution, share-alike) while adapting them for documentary instruments. The analogy is imperfect but productive: both domains concern the replication, modification, and governance of text that aspires to create real-world effects.

**9.3 On Hard Copy Reservation.** The reservation of Hard Copy rights serves multiple purposes: maintaining a canonical authoritative version, enabling sustainable support for the project through limited physical editions, and preserving the distinction between the freely-available framework and its potential formal instantiations.

**9.4 On the Fiction of Licensing.** All licenses operate through a peculiar fiction: that by copying text, one enters into agreement with its author. This fiction is no more or less strange than the fictions underlying the instruments themselves—that documentation creates moral custody, that rights can be delegated, that legitimacy can be conditioned. We are all engaged in collaborative world-building through carefully formatted text.

## Execution

This License is effective as of its publication in the canonical repository.

No signature is required. Use of the Original Work constitutes acceptance of these terms.

*However, if you feel compelled to sign something, we understand. The instruments in this repository may have that effect on people.*

---

**RLPL v1.0**
*A license for instruments about legitimacy, which is itself an instrument of uncertain legitimacy, licensing other instruments of aspirational legitimacy.*
