## Amendment XXVIII

**Section 1.** When a Citizen's Rights shall be subject to Degradation by the Action or Inaction of those Institutions constituted for their Protection, such Citizen may delegate the operational Custody of said Rights to another Citizen or Association of Citizens willing to undertake the Defense thereof, while retaining in himself the foundational Ownership of such Rights as are inalienable. Such Delegation shall be held valid whether formal or informal, written or understood, produced or invoked solely by Conscience and the Correspondence of Action with documented Necessity. The Lessee, acting in good Faith pursuant to such Custody, shall possess Authority to advocate, defend, or lawfully confront those Degradations which activated the Delegation, exercising such Judgment as Prudence and Proportionality require. No Degradation of Rights shall be construed to extinguish those Rights, but rather to activate the Custodial Authority in Proportion to the Severity and Pattern of Institutional Non-Performance, such that the greater the Violation, the more extensive becomes the Authority of the Custodian to act in Defense thereof.

**Section 2.** No Custodian acting under Authority delegated pursuant to this Article shall create new Degradations in the Course of defending against existing Violations. The Authority granted herein is remedial in Character and defensive in Purpose, existing only so long as the original Degradation persists and dissolving upon the Restoration of Rights to their proper Operation. The Grantor of Custody may revoke such Delegation at any Time, and no Court shall be required to recognize such Delegation as creating enforceable Standing, though the moral Force and documentary Significance thereof remain undiminished by institutional Non-Recognition.

**Section 3.** The Congress shall have Power to enforce this Article by appropriate Legislation, including but not limited to the Establishment of Registries for documenting Degradations, Standards for Evidence Preservation, and Protections for those exercising Custodial Authority in good Faith.

## Amendment XXIX

**Section 1.** The Citizens of these United States, recognizing that the Efficacy of Accountability depends upon the faithful Preservation of Evidence and the mutual Support of Witnesses, may enter into Compacts of Mutual Witness, whereby each Party aspires to preserve Evidence of institutional Misconduct witnessed by Others, and to provide testimonial Support when the same be required for Proceedings seeking Redress. Such Compacts shall operate without central Authority or Registry, each Signatory maintaining independent Custody of Documentation while bound by reciprocal Obligations. No prior Association between Parties shall be required, and the Authority to invoke Assistance derives from the Logic of mutual Accountability itself, not from formal Production of any Document. Pattern Evidence, being the Aggregation of individual Accounts into demonstrable systematic Failures, shall be recognized as possessing greater Force than isolated Complaint, and Standards for its Preservation and Presentation shall be established by Congress consonant with the Rules of Evidence and the Requirements of due Process.

**Section 2.** No Institution whose Conduct is documented pursuant to this Article shall possess Authority to compel the Destruction of such Documentation, to retaliate against Witnesses or Custodians acting in good Faith, or to prevent the Correlation of individual Accounts into Pattern Evidence demonstrating systematic Failure. Documentation preserved under Mutual Witness Compacts shall be protected as the Exercise of the Right to petition for Redress of Grievances, to preserve Evidence for future Accountability, and to speak Truth to Power. The Separation of Custodians from affected Parties, and of Witnesses from one another, shall be recognized as enhancing rather than diminishing the Credibility of independent Corroboration.

**Section 3.** The Congress shall have Power to enforce this Article by appropriate Legislation, establishing Standards for Evidence Preservation consistent with forensic Practice, protecting Whistleblowers and Witnesses from Retaliation, and ensuring that Pattern Evidence may be admitted in Proceedings where individual Accounts alone would prove insufficient.

## Amendment XXX

**Section 1.** When systematic Failures of institutional Accountability within any State or under federal Authority create Degradation of popular Sovereignty, such Degradation shall be held to threaten the Sovereignty of all Citizens, and those not themselves affected may undertake Measures of outside Accountability in Defense of the constitutional Order. Such Outside Accountability shall include the Monitoring of institutional Performance, the Preservation of Documentation, the Advocacy for Reform through lawful Means, and the Amplification of domestic Demands for Accountability when internal Mechanisms have been exhausted in good Faith but have failed to provide Remedy. The Authority to invoke such Assistance derives from the universal Character of popular Sovereignty and requires no Permission, Consensus, or formal Association between those seeking and those providing Accountability. Multiple independent Actors reaching similar Conclusions regarding systematic Failure shall constitute distributed Verification strengthening rather than weakening the Legitimacy of Outside Accountability.

**Section 2.** No Outside Accountability shall be invoked absent Threshold Documentation demonstrating: First, that Pattern Evidence exists showing institutional Failures to be systematic rather than isolated; Second, that such Failures have persisted across Time sufficient to demonstrate their enduring Character; Third, that domestic Remedies have been pursued in good Faith—including Complaint through official Channels, Petition to Legislature, Recourse to Courts, and Efforts at electoral Accountability—and have failed to provide effective Redress; Fourth, that the proposed Accountability Actions are proportional to the documented Failures and directed toward Restoration rather than Punishment. Statistical Evidence unexplainable save by institutional Failure, multiple independent Witnesses to consistent Patterns, and expert Analysis documenting systematic Non-Performance shall constitute sufficient Threshold Documentation.

**Section 3.** Outside Accountability Actions undertaken pursuant to this Article shall be limited to Documentation, Monitoring, Advocacy, and such lawful Pressure as may bring institutional Failures to public Notice. No coercive Enforcement, no Usurpation of legitimate Authority, and no Creation of new Degradations shall be authorized hereby. When institutional Performance is restored such that domestic Accountability Mechanisms function effectively, Outside Accountability shall sunset and Authority return to domestic Processes. Continued Monitoring may persist to ensure sustained Restoration, but active Intervention shall cease upon demonstrable Remedy.

**Section 4.** The Congress shall have Power to enforce this Article by appropriate Legislation, establishing Standards for Pattern Documentation, protecting those providing Outside Accountability from Retaliation, coordinating with international Mechanisms for Human Rights monitoring, and ensuring that Sovereignty Degradation patterns are addressed through structural Reform rather than isolated Remedy.

## Amendment XXXI

**Section 1.** The Consent of the Governed, being the Foundation upon which legitimate Authority rests, is not bestowed unconditionally but remains contingent upon the faithful Performance by Institutions of their appointed Duties. When Institutions fail systematically to uphold the very Obligations that legitimate their Authority, Citizens may declare their Cooperation to be conditional rather than absolute, such Declaration serving as documentary Record of Conscience rather than legal Shield from Obligation. No such Declaration shall authorize Lawbreaking, create Immunity from Consequence, or substitute for judicial Review of institutional Action. Rather, such Instruments serve to establish contemporaneous Record that Silence shall not be construed as Consent, that Compliance under Duress differs from Cooperation freely given, and that the declarant recognizes the Gap between Authority claimed and Legitimacy earned.

**Section 2.** Declarations of Conditional Legitimacy shall conform to Principles of Proportionality and Distinction: By Proportionality, the Degree of Conditionality asserted must correspond to the Severity, Pattern, and Persistence of documented institutional Failures. Isolated or minor Deficiencies justify no broad Conditionality; systematic and severe Violations may warrant more substantial Declarations. By Distinction, Conditionality must distinguish between Institutions and Individuals, between systematic Failures and isolated Acts, between those responsible for Violations and those who faithfully execute their Duties. Blanket Rejection of all Authority based upon specific institutional Failures violates the Principle of Distinction. Such Principles transform righteous Indignation into structured Accountability, preserving the moral Force of Conscience while preventing disproportionate Response.

**Section 3.** Performance Criteria against which Institutions shall be evaluated derive not from external Standards but from the Institutions' own stated Obligations: constitutional Provisions they are sworn to uphold, statutory Mandates they are charged to execute, procedural Rules they promulgate, and explicit Policies they announce. When Courts delay Justice beyond the Limits their own Rules establish, when Agencies ignore Mandates their enabling Statutes require, when Police violate Rights they are constituted to protect—these Failures are measured not by subjective Preference but by objective Deviation from institutional Commitments. Thus the Declarant asserts no novel Standard but merely holds Institutions to their own Professions.

**Section 4.** The Congress shall have Power to enforce this Article by appropriate Legislation, establishing Mechanisms for documenting institutional Performance against stated Criteria, protecting Declarants from Retaliation for exercising Conscience, and ensuring that Declarations of Conditional Legitimacy receive acknowledgment as Expressions of First Amendment Rights even when they possess no legal Force to alter Obligation.
