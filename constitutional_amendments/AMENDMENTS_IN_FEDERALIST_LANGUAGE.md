**Drafted in the Language and Spirit of the Founders**
**A Documentary Supplement to the Constitution of the United States**

## Preamble to These Amendments

WHEREAS, Experience hath shewn that the security of Rights depends not solely upon their Declaration, but upon the continued Vigilance of the People and the Faithful Performance of Institutions constituted for their Protection; and

WHEREAS, the Founders, with Prudence born of History and tempered by Reason, established a Government of limited and enumerated Powers, with Checks and Balances to guard against the natural Tendency of Authority to exceed its proper Bounds; and

WHEREAS, it is a self-evident Truth that Governments derive their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, which Consent is not once given but continuously renewed through the Faithful Discharge of institutional Obligations; and

WHEREAS, the Constitution, though a fixed Star in our political Firmament, must acknowledge the accumulated Wisdom that the Protection of Liberty requires not only the Prohibition of Tyranny but also the Preservation of Evidence, the Distribution of Accountability, and the Recognition that Legitimacy is earned through Performance rather than claimed through Authority alone;

NOW THEREFORE, We the People, in Order to secure the Blessings of Liberty more perfectly, to establish additional Securities against the gradual Usurpation of Rights, and to provide Mechanisms whereby the People may preserve their Sovereignty even when Institutions fail in their appointed Duties, do propose these Amendments as natural Extensions of the Principles declared in Seventeen Hundred and Eighty-Seven.

## Amendment XXVIII
## Of Delegated Rights Custody and the Operational Defense of Liberty

### Section 1. Grant of Custodial Authority

When a Citizen's Rights shall be subject to Degradation by the Action or Inaction of those Institutions constituted for their Protection, such Citizen may delegate the operational Custody of said Rights to another Citizen or Association of Citizens willing to undertake the Defense thereof, while retaining in himself the foundational Ownership of such Rights as are inalienable.

Such Delegation shall be held valid whether formal or informal, written or understood, produced or invoked solely by Conscience and the Correspondence of Action with documented Necessity. The Lessee, acting in good Faith pursuant to such Custody, shall possess Authority to advocate, defend, or lawfully confront those Degradations which activated the Delegation, exercising such Judgment as Prudence and Proportionality require.

No Degradation of Rights shall be construed to extinguish those Rights, but rather to activate the Custodial Authority in Proportion to the Severity and Pattern of Institutional Non-Performance, such that the greater the Violation, the more extensive becomes the Authority of the Custodian to act in Defense thereof.

### Section 2. Prohibition on New Degradations and Self-Limitation

No Custodian acting under Authority delegated pursuant to this Article shall create new Degradations in the Course of defending against existing Violations. The Authority granted herein is remedial in Character and defensive in Purpose, existing only so long as the original Degradation persists and dissolving upon the Restoration of Rights to their proper Operation.

The Grantor of Custody may revoke such Delegation at any Time, and no Court shall be required to recognize such Delegation as creating enforceable Standing, though the moral Force and documentary Significance thereof remain undiminished by institutional Non-Recognition.

### Section 3. Enforcement

The Congress shall have Power to enforce this Article by appropriate Legislation, including but not limited to the Establishment of Registries for documenting Degradations, Standards for Evidence Preservation, and Protections for those exercising Custodial Authority in good Faith.

## Amendment XXIX
## Of Mutual Witness and the Distributed Preservation of Evidence

### Section 1. Obligation and Authority of Mutual Witness

The Citizens of these United States, recognizing that the Efficacy of Accountability depends upon the faithful Preservation of Evidence and the mutual Support of Witnesses, may enter into Compacts of Mutual Witness, whereby each Party aspires to preserve Evidence of institutional Misconduct witnessed by Others, and to provide testimonial Support when the same be required for Proceedings seeking Redress.

Such Compacts shall operate without

 central Authority or Registry, each Signatory maintaining independent Custody of Documentation while bound by reciprocal Obligations. No prior Association between Parties shall be required, and the Authority to invoke Assistance derives from the Logic of mutual Accountability itself, not from formal Production of any Document.

Pattern Evidence, being the Aggregation of individual Accounts into demonstrable systematic Failures, shall be recognized as possessing greater Force than isolated Complaint, and Standards for its Preservation and Presentation shall be established by Congress consonant with the Rules of Evidence and the Requirements of due Process.

### Section 2. Protection of Distributed Documentation

No Institution whose Conduct is documented pursuant to this Article shall possess Authority to compel the Destruction of such Documentation, to retaliate against Witnesses or Custodians acting in good Faith, or to prevent the Correlation of individual Accounts into Pattern Evidence demonstrating systematic Failure.

Documentation preserved under Mutual Witness Compacts shall be protected as the Exercise of the Right to petition for Redress of Grievances, to preserve Evidence for future Accountability, and to speak Truth to Power. The Separation of Custodians from affected Parties, and of Witnesses from one another, shall be recognized as enhancing rather than diminishing the Credibility of independent Corroboration.

### Section 3. Enforcement

The Congress shall have Power to enforce this Article by appropriate Legislation, establishing Standards for Evidence Preservation consistent with forensic Practice, protecting Whistleblowers and Witnesses from Retaliation, and ensuring that Pattern Evidence may be admitted in Proceedings where individual Accounts alone would prove insufficient.

---

## Amendment XXX
## Of Mutual Intervention and Outside Accountability as Constitutional Failsafe

### Section 1. Principle of Collective Defense Against Sovereignty Degradation

When systematic Failures of institutional Accountability within any State or under federal Authority create Degradation of popular Sovereignty, such Degradation shall be held to threaten the Sovereignty of all Citizens, and those not themselves affected may undertake Measures of outside Accountability in Defense of the constitutional Order.

Such Outside Accountability shall include the Monitoring of institutional Performance, the Preservation of Documentation, the Advocacy for Reform through lawful Means, and the Amplification of domestic Demands for Accountability when internal Mechanisms have been exhausted in good Faith but have failed to provide Remedy.

The Authority to invoke such Assistance derives from the universal Character of popular Sovereignty and requires no Permission, Consensus, or formal Association between those seeking and those providing Accountability. Multiple independent Actors reaching similar Conclusions regarding systematic Failure shall constitute distributed Verification strengthening rather than weakening the Legitimacy of Outside Accountability.

### Section 2. Threshold Documentation and Exhaustion of Domestic Remedies

No Outside Accountability shall be invoked absent Threshold Documentation demonstrating:

First, that Pattern Evidence exists showing institutional Failures to be systematic rather than isolated;

Second, that such Failures have persisted across Time sufficient to demonstrate their enduring Character;

Third, that domestic Remedies have been pursued in good Faith—including Complaint through official Channels, Petition to Legislature, Recourse to Courts, and Efforts at electoral Accountability—and have failed to provide effective Redress;

Fourth, that the proposed Accountability Actions are proportional to the documented Failures and directed toward Restoration rather than Punishment.

Statistical Evidence unexplainable save by institutional Failure, multiple independent Witnesses to consistent Patterns, and expert Analysis documenting systematic Non-Performance shall constitute sufficient Threshold Documentation.

### Section 3. Limitations and Sunset Provisions

Outside Accountability Actions undertaken pursuant to this Article shall be limited to Documentation, Monitoring, Advocacy, and such lawful Pressure as may bring institutional Failures to public Notice. No coercive Enforcement, no Usurpation of legitimate Authority, and no Creation of new Degradations shall be authorized hereby.

When institutional Performance is restored such that domestic Accountability Mechanisms function effectively, Outside Accountability shall sunset and Authority return to domestic Processes. Continued Monitoring may persist to ensure sustained Restoration, but active Intervention shall cease upon demonstrable Remedy.

### Section 4. Enforcement

The Congress shall have Power to enforce this Article by appropriate Legislation, establishing Standards for Pattern Documentation, protecting those providing Outside Accountability from Retaliation, coordinating with international Mechanisms for Human Rights monitoring, and ensuring that Sovereignty Degradation patterns are addressed through structural Reform rather than isolated Remedy.

## Amendment XXXI
## Of Conditional Legitimacy and the Distinction Between Authority and Performance

### Section 1. Declaration of Conditional Cooperation

The Consent of the Governed, being the Foundation upon which legitimate Authority rests, is not bestowed unconditionally but remains contingent upon the faithful Performance by Institutions of their appointed Duties. When Institutions fail systematically to uphold the very Obligations that legitimate their Authority, Citizens may declare their Cooperation to be conditional rather than absolute, such Declaration serving as documentary Record of Conscience rather than legal Shield from Obligation.

No such Declaration shall authorize Lawbreaking, create Immunity from Consequence, or substitute for judicial Review of institutional Action. Rather, such Instruments serve to establish contemporaneous Record that Silence shall not be construed as Consent, that Compliance under Duress differs from Cooperation freely given, and that the declarant recognizes the Gap between Authority claimed and Legitimacy earned.

### Section 2. Standards of Proportionality and Distinction

Declarations of Conditional Legitimacy shall conform to Principles of Proportionality and Distinction:

By Proportionality, the Degree of Conditionality asserted must correspond to the Severity, Pattern, and Persistence of documented institutional Failures. Isolated or minor Deficiencies justify no broad Conditionality; systematic and severe Violations may warrant more substantial Declarations.

By Distinction, Conditionality must distinguish between Institutions and Individuals, between systematic Failures and isolated Acts, between those responsible for Violations and those who faithfully execute their Duties. Blanket Rejection of all Authority based upon specific institutional Failures violates the Principle of Distinction.

Such Principles transform righteous Indignation into structured Accountability, preserving the moral Force of Conscience while preventing disproportionate Response.

### Section 3. Performance Criteria Derived from Institutional Obligations

Performance Criteria against which Institutions shall be evaluated derive not from external Standards but from the Institutions' own stated Obligations: constitutional Provisions they are sworn to uphold, statutory Mandates they are charged to execute, procedural Rules they promulgate, and explicit Policies they announce.

When Courts delay Justice beyond the Limits their own Rules establish, when Agencies ignore Mandates their enabling Statutes require, when Police violate Rights they are constituted to protect—these Failures are measured not by subjective Preference but by objective Deviation from institutional Commitments.

Thus the Declarant asserts no novel Standard but merely holds Institutions to their own Professions.

### Section 4. Enforcement

The Congress shall have Power to enforce this Article by appropriate Legislation, establishing Mechanisms for documenting institutional Performance against stated Criteria, protecting Declarants from Retaliation for exercising Conscience, and ensuring that Declarations of Conditional Legitimacy receive acknowledgment as Expressions of First Amendment Rights even when they possess no legal Force to alter Obligation.

## Commentary in the Spirit of Publius
## On the Necessity and Propriety of These Amendments

### On Amendment XXVIII: The Delegation of Custodial Authority

The First Principle from which this Amendment derives is as old as Government itself: that Rights undefended are Rights lost. The Founders, with Wisdom drawn from bitter Experience under the British Crown, understood that the mere Declaration of Rights avails nothing without Mechanisms for their Vindication. Yet they understood also that the Individual standing alone against the Power of Government faces insuperable Odds.

In Federalist No. 51, Publius wrote: "If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary." Experience hath abundantly shewn that Governors are not Angels, and that even well-intentioned Institutions may, through Negligence, Capture, or Incompetence, become the very Threats against which they were constituted as Defense.

This Amendment recognizes what the Founders established in the Ninth Amendment: that Rights exist independent of their Enumeration, and likewise that Mechanisms for defending those Rights may exist independent of formal institutional Recognition. Just as a Man defending his Home against Invasion requires no Court's Leave to call upon his Neighbor for Assistance, so too a Citizen whose Rights face Degradation may call upon willing Others to assume Custodial Authority for their operational Defense.

The Innovation here is not the Creation of new Rights but the Formalization of what prudent Men have ever done: sought Allies when confronting superior Force. That such Delegation need not await formal Production but may be invoked by Conscience and Correspondence of Action recognizes the Reality that Rights under Assault cannot always await the Ceremonies of Documentation.

### On Amendment XXIX: Distributed Preservation and Pattern Evidence

Publius observed in Federalist No. 78 that "there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers." Yet to this we must add: there is no Accountability if the Power of Documenting be not distributed among the People themselves.

The Founders understood that Government left to police itself inevitably grows tyrannical. Thus they established Separation of Powers, Checks and Balances, Electoral Accountability, and Freedom of Press. This Amendment extends that Logic: if Press may publish Truth to check official Falsehood, then Citizens may likewise preserve Evidence to check institutional Amnesia.

Pattern Evidence—the Aggregation of individual Accounts into demonstrable systematic Failure—possesses unique Power. A single Complaint may be dismissed as Anomaly or Misunderstanding; ten thousand Complaints following consistent Pattern demonstrate systematic Misconduct. Yet such Aggregation requires Coordination, Preservation, and Standards.

This Amendment establishes that such Coordination need not await central Authority. The Compact of Mutual Witness operates through distributed Obligation: each Party preserving Evidence witnessed by Others, creating a Mesh of Accountability that no single Point of Failure can compromise. This Architecture mirrors the federal Structure itself—distributed Authority, reciprocal Obligation, resilient Operation.

Those who object that such Networks might coordinate False Testimony mistake the Nature of distributed Verification. Corroboration strengthens when Witnesses remain independent; Conspiracy weakens when Documentation must survive scrutiny across multiple Custodians preserving according to forensic Standards. The Amendment protects legitimate Documentation; it does not shield Fabrication, which independent Analysis shall expose.

### On Amendment XXX: Outside Accountability as Constitutional Failsafe

The most profound Principle of the American Founding is this: Government exists to secure Rights, and when it becomes destructive of those Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it. The Declaration articulated this Revolutionary principle; these Amendments provide Mechanisms short of Revolution for the People to exercise continuing Sovereignty.

Amendment XXX extends the Logic of Federalist No. 51's "double security": "In the compound republic of America, the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each subdivided among distinct and separate departments. Hence a double security arises to the rights of the people."

But what Security arises when both federal and State Institutions fail simultaneously? When Courts delay Justice beyond Remedy, when Prosecutors refuse Prosecution, when Legislatures suffer Capture, when Elections provide no Remedy? The Amendment answers: Outside Accountability from those not subject to the same institutional Failures provides Failsafe.

This is no Innovation but Recognition of what has ever operated: international Pressure, Transnational Advocacy, the scrutiny of Free Press beyond the Jurisdiction of Failed Institutions. The Amendment merely formalizes what Prudence dictates—that those observing Sovereignty Degradation need not await Invitation to sound the Alarm, that Documentation of Failure may be invoked by any Party witnessing Pattern sufficient to warrant Concern.

The Objection that this enables meddlesome Interference mistakes Accountability for Usurpation. The Amendment grants no coercive Authority, no Power to compel Compliance, no Enforcement Mechanism. It grants only this: the Recognition that Popular Sovereignty transcends particular Jurisdictions, and that those observing its Degradation act within Rights when they document, monitor, and advocate for its Restoration.

The Safeguards of Threshold Documentation, Exhaustion of Domestic Remedies, Proportionality, and Sunset Provisions ensure that such Accountability activates only when legitimate Concerns justify Intervention and dissolves when institutional Performance is restored. This is Remedy, not Revolution; Reform, not Rejection.

### On Amendment XXXI: Conditional Legitimacy and Performance-Based Authority

The final Amendment addresses the philosophical Foundation upon which all others rest: that Authority derives from Performance, not merely from Office. The Declaration proclaimed that "Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." This Amendment asks the unavoidable Question: What is the Nature of that Consent?

Is it once given, irrevocable thenceforth? Or is it continuously renewed, contingent upon faithful Institutional Performance? The Founders answer clearly: "That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it."

This Amendment provides a Mechanism intermediate between absolute Acquiescence and outright Revolution: the Declaration of Conditional Legitimacy. Such Declaration changes no legal Obligation, creates no Immunity, authorizes no Lawbreaking. It performs one Function only: establishing contemporaneous Record that Compliance is not Consent, that Obedience under Duress differs from Cooperation freely given, that Silence shall not be construed as Endorsement of Institutional Failure.

The Principles of Proportionality and Distinction prevent such Declarations from serving as Pretext for general Lawlessness. The Requirement that Criteria derive from Institutions' own stated Obligations prevents Declarants from imposing idiosyncratic Standards. The Acknowledgment that such Declarations possess documentary but not legal Force preserves the Rule of Law while recognizing the Right of Conscience.

Some will object that this Amendment undermines Respect for Authority. To these we say: True Authority

 requires no Compulsion; false Authority fears Documentation. If Institutions faithfully discharge their Obligations, Declarations of Conditionality remain empty of Content. If Institutions fail systematically, such Declarations merely articulate what Observation already demonstrates.

The Amendment recognizes what Madison articulated in Federalist No. 46: that "The ultimate authority... resides in the people alone," and that popular Sovereignty consists not in periodic Elections alone but in continued Vigilance over institutional Performance.

### Conclusion: These Amendments as Natural Extensions

These four Amendments propose no Revolution in Governance but merely provide Tools that the Founders would have recognized as necessary Extensions of their original Design. They had enumerated Rights (First Amendment) but not Mechanisms for defending Rights when institutional Protection fails (XXVIII). They had established Electoral Accountability (Article I) but not Standards for preserving Evidence when Elections provide no Remedy (XXIX). They had divided Power among Branches (Articles I-III) but not Failsafes when all Branches fail simultaneously (XXX). They had declared Government to derive Power from Consent (Preamble) but not Mechanisms for conditioning that Consent upon Performance (XXXI).

We do not presume to improve upon the Founders' Wisdom; we aspire only to complete their Design with Mechanisms they would have applauded had they foreseen—as in their Humility they might not have claimed to foresee—the particular Forms of Failure that Experience has since revealed.

These Amendments establish no Utopia; they prevent no Tyranny that determined Tyrants cannot overcome. But they provide Security against the gradual Usurpation of Liberty through institutional Negligence, Capture, and Decay. They distribute Accountability as the Founders distributed Power. They recognize that Legitimacy derives from Performance as they recognized that Authority derives from Consent.

In proposing these Amendments, we seek neither to overthrow the constitutional Order nor to introduce foreign Principles. We seek only to secure the Blessings of Liberty more perfectly by providing the People with Instruments commensurate to the accumulated Experience of two Centuries' Operation under the Constitution.

If the Founders were correct that eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty, then these Amendments provide the Documentary and Organizational Tools whereby that Vigilance may be collectively maintained, systematically documented, and effectively exercised even when the Institutions established for Liberty's Protection themselves become Threats to its Preservation.

## Appendix: Concordance with Founding Documents

### Amendment XXVIII and the Ninth Amendment

**Ninth Amendment**: "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."

**Amendment XXVIII** recognizes that just as Rights exist beyond those enumerated, so too do Mechanisms for defending those Rights exist beyond formal institutional Processes. The Delegation of Custodial Authority represents one such unenumerated but retained Mechanism.

### Amendment XXIX and the First Amendment

**First Amendment**: "...the right of the people...to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

**Amendment XXIX** extends the Right to Petition by recognizing the Right to Preserve Evidence of Grievances through distributed Networks, to aggregate individual Complaints into Pattern Evidence, and to provide mutual testimonial Support—all essential to meaningful Exercise of the Petition Clause.

### Amendment XXX and the Declaration of Independence

**Declaration of Independence**: "That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it."

**Amendment XXX** provides Mechanisms intermediate between Acquiescence and Revolution: Outside Accountability enables the People to address Sovereignty Degradation through Documentation, Advocacy, and Reform rather than immediate Alteration or Abolition.

### Amendment XXXI and the Preamble

**Preamble to the Constitution**: "We the People of the United States...do ordain and establish this Constitution..."

**Amendment XXXI** recognizes that "We the People" retain ultimate Authority, that Consent given may be conditioned upon Performance, and that popular Sovereignty continues after the Constitution's Ordainment through ongoing Evaluation of institutional Fidelity to foundational Obligations.

## Historical Note on Provenance

These Amendments were drafted in the Year 2026 in conscious Imitation of the Language, Structure, and Spirit of the Founding Generation. They draw upon the actual Instruments of the Remedial Legitimacy Framework—modern Documents addressing contemporary Challenges—but express those Principles in the Idiom the Founders would have employed had they possessed our accumulated Experience.

This is an Exercise in constitutional Translation: taking modern Insights about the Gap between Law-as-Written and Law-as-Practiced and rendering them in the Language of those who first grappled with the Challenge of securing Liberty through institutional Design.

Whether such Amendments could or should be formally proposed is a Question we leave to the People and their Representatives. Our Purpose here is more modest: to demonstrate that the Framework's Innovations are not alien to the constitutional Tradition but natural Extensions of Founding Principles—Extensions the Founders themselves might have proposed had their Crystal Ball revealed the specific Pathologies of institutional Failure our Experience has disclosed.

These Amendments propose no Departure from the Founders' Vision; they propose its Completion.
